10,10,Ham,"hey there - - life sounds horribly busy . i figured it was .
don ' t worry about me - - i just thought we should get things moving - - since
now i have officially been replaced , and it has been announced to my direct
reports here in london . fernley ( not sure if you have spoken to him ) is
anxious to put an announcement out to enron europe that phillip lord and i
are leaving and that melissa will be stepping in to replace us .
since phillip already has a place to go , it would be nice if we could at
least say that i am going to north america energy ops , or something - - even
if we don ' t have all of the details worked out .
i am not sure if you want me to come over and meet some of your commercial ""
customers "" - - - also - i have never met delainey ( i don ' t think ) - - but
maybe knowing frevert well is enough . i am planning to come in november
( first half ) to work on europe ' s plan and coordinate with brent , wes and the
other groups under frevert , so maybe i can meet some people then . would love
to discuss
monday is fine - - as i am sure today will be another crazy day .
i know how all of those reviews are . john sherriff put a o 5 per review per
day penalty on any dept head who didn ' t have their reviews done by august
15 th , and of course i was on holiday the week before that , so i had 2 days to
do 10 reviews .
hopefully i can help you with that direct report problem .
if i don ' t talk to you today , then have a good weekend ,
beth
enron capital & trade resources corp .
from : sally beck 13 / 10 / 2000 01 : 19
to : beth apollo / lon / ect @ ect
cc :
subject : stuff
crazy week - - 7 : 00 pm and i just finished a project for delainey that i got
at noon today . cancelled everything on the calendar and have been immersed
ever since . patti gave me your message with your home number around 5 : 30
today , just as she was leaving - - apologized for not giving it to me
earlier . however , given my immediate project , i don ' t think that i could
have called until now . and at 1 : 00 am london time , i think that this e : mail
is much better .
i am still really crunched tomorrow morning . all of our mid - year reviews
must be completed by the time we have our ena office of the chair staff
meeting at 2 : 30 tomorrow . big push , after an over percentage completion rate
of about 60 % at our ena meeting two weeks ago . some of those unfinished
reviews were mine to give ( 16 direct reports is a killer ) . i wrote three
last night after tyler went to bed , finished at 1 : 00 am and gave all three
reviews this morning . i have 5 more to write tonight , and to deliver
tomorrow morning to be at 100 % . i will try to call you on my way into the
office tomorrow morning from the car . if i miss you then , it will be late
afternoon houston time before i could call you . next week shapes up to be
much better .
i am definitely very interested in continuing our conversations . would love
to have to over here and involved in operations . so i will either catch you
from my car tomorrow morning , or we can talk on monday .",

a sprained foot he suffered the injury in indianapolis' previous game against the patriots terrence wilkins or reggie wayne will start in his place consider reserving pathon this week ty detmer qb det free agent updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber detmer was benched on monday night after another poor outing he was replaced by charlie batch and may have lost his starting qb spot in any event neither signal caller has much fantasy value kevan barlow rb sf grid iron goons updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber barlow is still being hampered by a quadriceps injury but will continue to play despite the ailment it happened what two months ago and it probably won't heal until the offseason i just have to work through it barlow told the san francisco chronicle people don't know how bad this is hurting the injury could hamper barlow's playing time in the future so be cautious when starting him fantasy wise j j stokes wr sf uran man updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber stokes who injured his knee during sunday's win over carolina is listed as probable for this weekend's contest at atlanta he's been inconsistent thus far and shouldn't be depended on to produce fantasy wise duce staley rb phi luccis losers updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber according to head coach andy reid staley's shoulder injury will not cost him the starting rb spot however he did say that staley will be eased back into the role after the team's bye week so expect correll buckhalter to see the majority of the carries when philly plays the n y giants on october escapenumber bubba franks te gb president taft updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber franks suffered a slight knee injury during sunday's loss to tampa bay the injury isn't considered serious however and franks is expected to start this weekend against baltimore raghib ismail wr dal free agent updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber ismail knee will work into drills this week which means that there is a possibility that he will return for monday's game against washington even if he does return he's not worth starting for a fantasy perspective jackie harris te dal free agent updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber harris who has been struggling with a groin injury is expected to participate in drills this week he'll likely be available for monday's game against washington barring any setbacks anthony wright qb dal houston big ballers updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber with quincy carter out for two weeks wright will be dallas' starting qb for at least next week's game you may actually want to consider starting wright this week against washington but you'd have to be pretty desperate quincy carter qb dal free agent updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber carter is now expected to miss four to six weeks due to a hamstring injury anthony wright will start in carter's place but neither qb has much fantasy value at this point fred baxter te chi free agent updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber baxter hip who was inactive for sunday's game against atlanta could be out for this weekend's game as well the veteran tight end has very little value as a fantasy player at this point so the injury won't make a huge impact james allen rb chi texas terminators updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber allen will remain the bears' no escapenumber tailback at least for the moment rookie anthony thomas will see an increase in playing time however so allen's fantasy value will likely take a hit anthony thomas rb chi president taft updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber according to the chicago sun times thomas will not take over the starting rb spot in chicago at least not yet head coach dick jaroun will stick with current no escapenumber tailback james allen for the time being but thomas will see an increase in playing time and is worth picking up fantasy wise redskins dt was free agent updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber defensive end bruce smith who was knocked out of sunday's game against the giants with a dislocated right shoulder will miss two to three weeks while the tissue in his right shoulder heals and he regains his strength and range of motion you shouldn't be using the redskins' defense on a weekly basis in a fantasy league to begin with keyshawn johnson wr tb orange roughy updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber johnson suffered a shoulder contusion when it was driven into the ground during the fourth quarter of sunday's game against green bay he should be fine for week five but see how he fares in practice before making a decision on starting him next week tiki barber rb nyg team chick updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber the giants said that barber should be able to return from a hamstring injury next sunday in st louis however it is unclear whether he will get the majority of the carries over ron dayne so be careful starting either unless the giants' rb picture clears up by then ron dayne rb nyg texas terminators updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber dayne left sunday's game against washington with a neck stinger an injury which the giants said was not serious he should be able to play next sunday in st louis corey bradford wr gb luccis losers updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber bradford left sunday's game in tampa bay with cramps after returning a kickoff he will be re evaluated on monday ryan leaf qb tb free agent updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber the cowboys remain interest in leaf despite ligament damage in his wrist according to the fort worth star telegram they may sign him to the roster and place him on injured reserve leaf offers no fantasy value at this stage of his career quincy carter qb dal free agent updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber carter said the next escapenumber hours would determine whether he will be able to play a week from monday against washington according to the dallas morning news he has a strained left hamstring that he said he felt pop during the first quarter of sunday's game carter isn't a recommended fantasy starter even when healthy matt hasselbeck qb sea texas terminators updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber hasselbeck groin missed seattle's win over jacksonville and watched trent dilfer lead the team to escapenumber points still mike holmgren claimed the injured hasselbeck will remain seattle's starter i said it before and i'll say it again holmgren told the seattle times matt hasselbeck is our quarterback hasselbeck's status for seattle's next game is unclear laveranues coles wr nyj team dick updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber coles sprained his ankle at buffalo the injury is not considered to be serious terry glenn wr ne luccis losers updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber glenn is eligible to start practicing but the patriots have applied for a roster exemption so he can get into playing shape don't expect him to be a solid contributor to the new england passing game in the near future when he will make his return to the lineup is still unclear ray lucas qb mia c dawg's boyz updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber lucas appeared in short yardage sets on sunday he still won't play often enough to affect jay fiedler's numbers kevin kasper wr den texas terminators updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber kasper suffered a severely sprained right ankle on sunday and will miss three to six weeks travis mcgriff or chris cole might see more time in the passing game while kasper is out rickey dudley te cle team chick updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber dudley played with a sprained foot on sunday he is not expected to miss any playing time patrick johnson wr bal free agent updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber johnson is expected to miss eight weeks with a clavicle injury he had already started to fall behind the emerging travis taylor as a preferred target in the passing game chris weinke qb car houston big ballers updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber weinke was extremely ineffective against the niners sunday he completed only escapenumber of escapenumber passes for escapenumber yards three of his incompletions resulted in interceptions while he threw only one touchdown pass weinke was effective in the season opener but has proven to be a fantasy reserve at best wesley walls te car team chick updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber walls proved to be quarterback chris weinke's best target sunday against the escapenumberers catching escapenumber passes for escapenumber yards and a score walls won't do this every week but he will get a lot of looks from weinke when he can't find his receivers terrell owens wr sf team chick updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber owens was productive once again on sunday catching eight passes for escapenumber yards and two scores look for him to do well next week against atlanta garrison hearst rb sf really rottens updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber hearst did not score but provided decent production sunday against the panthers gaining escapenumber yards on escapenumber carries he is not starter material at this point but will be a good backup in most fantasy leagues jeff garcia qb sf c dawg's boyz updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber garcia was solid once again in sunday's game against the panthers he threw for escapenumber yards and two touchdown passes against only one interception aaron brooks qb no grid iron goons updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber brooks turned in his second consecutive mediocre performance sunday he only threw for escapenumber yards with an interception and no touchdown passes brooks has struggled in the last two games but the saints will stick with him as the starter since they are winning games michael vick qb atl really rottens updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber vick was an adequate replacement for the injured chris chandler but he failed to lead the falcons to the end zone he completed escapenumber of escapenumber passes for escapenumber yards and also gained escapenumber yards on four carries look for vick to return to the bench next week patrick jeffers wr car c dawg's boyz updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber jeffers knees missed sunday's game against san francisco he continues to make progress in his recovery from multiple knee surgeries but isn't ready to return to action just yet kevan barlow rb sf grid iron goons updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber barlow recently revealed that he is playing with a quadriceps injury that has hampered his ability since training camp it happened what two months ago and it probably won't heal until the offseason i just have to work through it barlow told the san francisco chronicle people don't know how bad this is hurting barlow will continue to play but the injury might prevent him from taking over as the full time running back keep him on your bench for now shawn jefferson wr atl free agent updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber jefferson missed most of the second half of sunday's game due to neck and back injuries he will be evaluated on a daily basis receivers terance mathis brian finneran and quentin mccord will be the wideouts next week if he is inactive nick goings rb car texas terminators updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber goings was inactive for sunday's game as tim biakabutuka resumed his job as the starting running back keep goings on your bench for now tim biakabutuka rb car c dawg's boyz updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber biakabutuka started sunday's game after being benched a week earlier he wasn't too effective gaining escapenumber yards on escapenumber rushes biakabutuka also caught two passes for escapenumber yards keep biakabutuka on your bench if you have depth at running back chris chandler qb atl orange roughy updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber chandler left sunday's game after suffering a concussion the injury was diagnosed as a grade escapenumber concussion the least severe on the scale he is listed as day to day michael vick will start next sunday if he is unable to play j j stokes wr sf uran man updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber stokes sprained his knee in sunday's game but stayed in the contest he will be evaluated on a daily basis stokes had just one catch in the game for six yards laveranues coles wr nyj team dick updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber coles caught five passes for escapenumber yards and carried the ball two times for escapenumber yards at buffalo coles has apparently become an important part of the new york offense in his second pro season anthony becht te nyj free agent updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber becht caught three passes for escapenumber yards and a td at buffalo despite some early struggles becht still appears to be an key member of the new york passing game on third downs and near the goal line peerless price wr buf drock's beaatchs updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber price caught four passes for escapenumber yards and a td against the jets don't expect big numbers from price again in the near future he very rarely breaks loose for a big play the escapenumber yard td pass he caught in week four is not one of his usual feats travis henry rb buf c dawg's boyz updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber henry rushed for escapenumber yards on escapenumber carries against the jets against low quality defenses that appear on the schedule henry should continue to be a good fantasy option keenan mccardell wr jac uran man updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber mccardell caught seven passes for escapenumber yards at seattle the veteran wideout looks to be in good health again and should be a solid fantasy starter for the rest of the year itula mili te sea free agent updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber mili caught two passes for escapenumber yards and a td against jacksonville mili is quick and has good hands he is worth a look if you need help at the tight end position shaun alexander rb sea houston big ballers updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber alexander rushed for escapenumber yards on escapenumber carries and scored two tds against jacksonville he will continue to be a good fantasy starter while ricky watters is out and alexander seems to be more of a td threat than watters can be right now stacey mack rb jac drock's beaatchs updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber mack was benched at seattle on sunday in the second quarter after rushing for only escapenumber yards on eight carries on his final attempt of the day he lost a fumble and was replaced by rookie elvis joseph the first year back rushed for only escapenumber yards and fumbled as well but he caught an escapenumber yard td pass now there will be major questions as to who will start the next game at rb for the jaguars if fred taylor is not ready to return from a groin injury after the bye week tyrone wheatley rb oak uran man updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber wheatley scored two tds against dallas on sunday his rushing totals escapenumber yards were modest however and it's still tough to start him on a weekly basis due to the presence of charlie garner tim brown wr oak uran man updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber brown caught seven passes for escapenumber yards in oakland's win over dallas he continues to be one of the more consistent receivers in the league from a fantasy perspective joey galloway wr dal team chick updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber dallas tried to open up their offense against oakland and galloway's numbers improved slightly as a result he had his best game of the season posting escapenumber yards receiving and a td those are modest numbers however so don't think of starting him on a weekly basis aaron stecker rb tb president taft updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber stecker rushed for only six yards on two carries against green bay he does not appear to be a viable option for the buccaneers while warrick dunn is out tampa bay apparently still has faith in mike alstott emmitt smith rb dal team dick updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber smith was held in check once again posting only escapenumber yards of total offense against oakland without an effective passing game smith is going to have a long season anthony wright qb dal houston big ballers updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber wright took over at qb for dallas after quincy carter left in the first quarter with a strained hamstring he completed escapenumber of escapenumber for escapenumber yards and two tds against oakland but still has very little value as a fantasy player mike alstott rb tb luccis losers updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber alstott rushed for escapenumber yards on escapenumber carries and a td against the packers the big fullback proved he can still be a dependable fantasy rb frank wycheck te ten drock's beaatchs updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber wycheck left sunday's game against baltimore with a neck strain he did not return to the game and will be re evaluated on monday antonio freeman wr gb drock's beaatchs updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber freeman caught only one pass for six yards at tampa bay with the emergence of bill schroeder freeman has become the less desirable option of green bay's starting wideouts olandis gary rb den houston big ballers updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber gary carried the ball only nine times for escapenumber yards in denver's escapenumber escapenumber win over kansas city he may have slipped to no escapenumber on the depth chart behind mike anderson mike anderson rb den really rottens updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber anderson posted escapenumber yards rushing and a score against kansas city on sunday he received much more of the workload in the denver backfield than olandis gary and may be emerging as the team's no escapenumber back bill schroeder wr gb grid iron goons updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber schroeder caught four passes for escapenumber yards and a td at tampa bay the green bay wideout performed well against a very tough defense proving he has indeed become a quality fantasy player rod smith wr den blue balls updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber smith had another huge outing posting eight receptions for escapenumber yards and a score against kansas city smith is establishing himself as one of the best wideouts in the league this season and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis brian griese qb den really rottens updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber griese struggled for the second consecutive week posting only escapenumber yards passing and a td against kansas city griese's numbers are being hurt somewhat by the loss of ed mccaffrey but he still warrants a weekly starting spot in most leagues fantasy wise priest holmes rb kc houston big ballers updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber holmes put up decent numbers against denver posting seven receptions and escapenumber yards of total offense he's not worthy of a starting spot every week but he could be useful when the matchup is right trent green qb kc blue balls updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber green came back to earth after a solid performance last weekend against washington green was picked off four times by the denver defense and was held without a td pass in the chiefs' escapenumber escapenumber loss keyshawn johnson wr tb orange roughy updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber johnson left sunday's game vs green bay for a brief period in the third quarter with an apparent shoulder injury he returned to the game after an examination on the sidelines maurice smith rb atl dont mess updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber smith rushed for escapenumber yards on escapenumber carries against the bears smith lacks the speed and burst to be a solid fantasy rb for the rest of the year don't count on him as anything more than a reserve despite the respectable look of his final week four numbers marcus robinson wr chi president taft updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber robinson caught nine passes for escapenumber yards and a td against the falcons robinson has reclaimed his spot among fantasy football's top wideouts now that he is healthy again martay jenkins wr ari free agent updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber jenkins caught six passes for escapenumber yards and a td against the eagles don't expect such totals from jenkins on a regular basis he might draw more defensive attention in the coming weeks and has never proved he can put up good numbers in the past todd pinkston wr phi drock's beaatchs updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber pinkston caught four passes for escapenumber yards and two tds against the cardinals the young wideout has quickly emerged as a quality fantasy player because of his good hands concentration and leaping ability correll buckhalter rb phi uran man updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber buckhalter rushed for escapenumber yards on escapenumber carries against arizona the rookie has put up fine yardage numbers in his pair of starts in place of the injured duce staley jake plummer qb ari really rottens updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber plummer threw for escapenumber yards two tds and an interception in a win over philadelphia his respectable performance against the eagles' strong defense should convince many fantasy owners to take a chance on him as a backup jay fiedler qb mia c dawg's boyz updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber fiedler threw for only escapenumber yards and a td and was intercepted once by the patriots don't depend on fiedler for quality fantasy numbers on a weekly basis james mcknight wr mia free agent updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber mcknight caught two passes for just escapenumber yards against the patriots the veteran wideout cannot be counted on for reliable fantasy production troy brown wr ne houston big ballers updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber brown caught five passes for escapenumber yards at

the rookie posted five receptions for escapenumber yards in the game antowain smith rb ne team dick updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber smith rushed for escapenumber yards and a td at miami while he may not post consistently good yardage numbers the rest of the year smith will continue to be a td threat rob johnson qb buf grid iron goons updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber

midway through the first half quincy carter qb dal free agent updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber carter left sunday's game against oakland in the first quarter due to a strained left hamstring he did not return to the game and will be re evaluared on monday anthony wright replaced the rookie qb in the lineup for dallas travis taylor wr bal drock's beaatchs updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber taylor had his second consecutive good outing on sunday posting five receptions and a touchdown in baltimore's escapenumber escapenumber victory over tennessee if he continues to produce taylor may warrant a starting role from a fantasy perspective on a more regular basis peter warrick wr cin dont mess updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber warrick caught four passes for just escapenumber yards against the steelers jon kitna has been working more exclusively with darnay scott and warrick hasn't put up good fantasy numbers yet this season jason brookins rb bal houston big ballers updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber brookins saw an increase in his carries on sunday against tennessee and his numbers really reflected it he posted escapenumber yards and a touchdown in baltimore's escapenumber escapenumber victory and could see more playing time in the ravens' offense from now on hines ward wr pit team chick updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber ward caught eight passes escapenumber yards against the bengals he continues to be pittsburgh's only reliable wide receiver and now qualifies as a solid fantasy reserve terry allen rb bal texas terminators updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber allen finally had a productive game posting escapenumber yards rushing and a touchdown against tennessee however he still isn't a player that fantasy owners should depend on for consistent production erron kinney te ten free agent updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber kinney had a solid game against baltimore posting seven catches for escapenumber yards he is putting a dent into frank wycheck's numbers early in the year and will likely play a more prominent role in the titans' offense this season jerome bettis rb pit blue balls updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber bettis rushed for escapenumber yards on escapenumber carries against cincinnati he will continue to stack up good numbers from a yardage perspective but the pittsburgh offense is not giving him enough scoring opportunities ricky williams rb no uran man updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber despite a slight shoulder injury

of total offense against new orleans unless you play in a deeper league you may want to consider dropping bennett altogether mark brunell qb jac president taft updated escapenumber escapenumber

enron corp . reduced its previously reported net income dating back to 1997 by $ 586 million , or 20 % , mostly due to improperly accounting for its dealings with partnerships run by some company officers .
the disclosure , contained in a securities and exchange commission filing , came even as the houston energy - trading company continued its merger talks with rival dynegy inc . dynegy , an independent power producer and utility owner , is looking at acquiring enron for roughly $ 7 billion to $ 8 billion , people familiar with the talks say . however , those talks could also be influenced by whether enron is further downgraded by major credit - ratings agencies .
the total price being discussed would equate to about $ 10 an enron share , barely above where the stock is currently trading and far below the level of even two weeks ago . as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday , enron shares were down 7 . 1 % , or 64 cents , to $ 8 . 41 , a tenth of their 52 - week high of $ 84 . 875 .
on the big board , dynegy traded at $ 36 . 50 , up $ 3 . 50 . shares of several energy - trading companies were up yesterday following a directive from federal regulators that the california state government pay an estimated $ 1 . 6 billion for past power purchases .
in yesterday ' s sec filing , enron also made major adjustments in its reported assets , debt and shareholder equity back to 1997 . for instance , for the three - month period ended sept . 30 , enron lopped about $ 2 . 2 billion , or 19 % , off shareholder equity , reducing it to a total of $ 9 . 5 billion . previously , the company had disclosed a reduction of only $ 1 . 2 billion .
the filing also said that enron discharged ben glisan , the company treasurer , and kristina mordaunt , the general counsel of enron ' s north america unit , in connection with investments they made in one of the officer - run limited partnerships . until yesterday , enron had insisted that mr . glisan wasn ' t associated with the officer - run partnerships . the company wouldn ' t explain why the the two had been discharged , and mr . glisan and ms . mordaunt couldn ' t be reached to comment .
the sec filing is the latest chapter in a crisis that has engulfed the nation ' s biggest energy - trading company during the past month . during that time , enron has reported a big third - quarter loss , the replacement of its chief financial officer who ran two of the controversial partnerships , and an sec investigation .
the sec filing raises further questions about enron ' s accounting procedures and disclosure policies . concerns over these matters are vexing investors and analysts , including those at major credit - rating agencies . the agencies downgraded enron debt during recent weeks and have the company on review for further downgrades .
ralph pellecchia , credit analyst for fitch , said he couldn ' t predict what effect the sec filing would have on enron ' s credit rating , but he added that the document contained damaging disclosures . "" it ' s bad , "" he said .
the enron sec filing also raises questions about the conduct of its outside auditor , arthur andersen llp , which reviewed the company ' s annual financial statements and certified them as consistent with accepted accounting principals . because of all the accounting adjustments "" the audit reports covering the year - end financial statements for 1997 - 2000 should not be relied upon , "" yesterday ' s sec filing said .
an andersen spokesman called enron ' s restatement announcement "" an unfortunate situation "" but said the accounting firm is "" cooperating with the company . . . to bring resolution to these matters . "" he said he couldn ' t comment further because of client - confidentiality concerns .
among the accounting turnabouts , enron said it had improperly accounted for two partnerships connected to michael
kopper , a former managing director of the company ' s north america unit . the two partnerships were known as joint energy development investments lp , or jedi , and chewco investments lp .
as reported , mr . kopper managed the general partner of chewco , which was formed in 1997 . jedi had been formed in 1993 by enron in partnership with the huge california public employees ' retirement system , or calpers .
in 1997 enron , which operated jedi , bought out calpers ' interest for $ 383 million and immediately sold it to chewco , according to the sec filing . almost all the money for chewco ' s purchase came in loans from jedi and an unnamed financial institution , whose loan was guaranteed by enron .
by having a supposed outside party in the form of chewco as a partner , enron treated jedi as an unconsolidated affiliate and kept hundreds of millions of dollars of partnership debt off its balance sheet . enron now acknowledges that treatment was wrong and that both jedi and chewco should have been consolidated starting in 1997 . taking that step retroactively resulted in a $ 396 million reduction in net income for the years 1997 to 2000 , the sec filing said .
mr . kopper , who left enron in july to run the partnerships , didn ' t return a phone call seeking comment . in the past , he has declined to be interviewed .
enron also retroactively consolidated some of the results of its dealings with a partnership called ljm cayman lp . that consolidation reduced 1999 and 2000 net income by $ 103 million .
ljm and a similar but much larger partnership , called ljm 2 co - investment lp , were formed in 1999 by enron ' s then - chief financial officer andrew fastow , who was replaced last month . the two partnerships were run by mr . fastow and mr . kopper , according to the enron sec filing and private partnership documents . enron ' s sec filing said the company believes that mr . fastow sold his interests in the ljm partnerships in july to mr . kopper . mr . fastow has declined to be interviewed .
several analysts said they were troubled that none of the earnings restatements were directly attributed to the much larger ljm 2 partnership . some also pointed to a sentence in the sec filing that said "" it is possible "" that continuing enron reviews will "" identify additional or different information concerning these matters . ""
as such , "" there remains doubt about whether there is something else in the closet , "" said brian youngberg , energy analyst at edward jones in st . louis .
the enron sec filing gave new information about the effect on company earnings of transactions related to the ljm partnerships . since 1999 , those transactions produced $ 577 . 8 million in pretax earnings , despite a $ 711 million pretax charge in this year ' s third quarter due to the termination of deals with several ljm 2 - related entities . the filing also estimated that mr . fastow received more than $ 30 million from the ljm partnerships .

you ' d be better informed if , instead of listening to what we say , you watch what we do . ' '
that excellent advice was not issued by enron management , although it should have been . instead it came more than 30 years ago from john n . mitchell , president richard m . nixon ' s attorney general .
enron ' s restatement of earnings yesterday did not go far enough to allow investors to understand all of what went on during the company ' s many strange transactions with related parties . it is now consolidating the results of some of its off - balance - sheet creations , though what happened in the most important ones remains a mystery .
but the restatement should , at the least , cause investors and wall street analysts to realize they have been fooled by so - called pro forma earnings , which leave out unpleasant realities and ignore accounting rules .
in january , enron told investors its ' ' recurring net income , ' ' as it calls its pro forma number , would be $ 1 . 70 to $ 1 . 75 a share this year . the company ' s share price rose to $ 82 when that forecast was made .
remarkably , enron is still on course to hit that target . yesterday ' s restatement raised its nine - month earnings figure by a penny , to $ 1 . 36 . and yet enron appears to be willing to sell out for about $ 10 a share , or less than six times its reported profits , which still appear to be growing . why so little ?
the answer may be that enron ' s board knows those numbers are not reliable measures of performance . enron ' s failure to disclose more about the still unconsolidated subsidiaries is an indication that the unreleased facts would not be reassuring . and enron cannot stay in business unless customers and investors believe it is financially solid . so it is willing to sell out for a fraction of what it appeared to be worth only weeks ago . don ' t call it a takeover . takeunder would be a better term .
what set off enron ' s collapse ? it now appears to have been a mistake . enron says it added $ 1 billion to shareholder equity in 2000 and early this year in error . the mistake did nothing to improve enron ' s profits at the time , so it seems unlikely it was deliberate . had the mistake not been made , the reduction in shareholder equity it disclosed last month would have been $ 200 million , not $ 1 . 2 billion . that reduction scared investors into believing that enron ' s transactions with partnerships led by andrew fastow , its former chief financial officer , had been disastrous for the company . now it appears they may not have been so bad .
but that fact is not very important now . enron ' s new disclosures indicate that perhaps 40 percent of its reported profits in 2000 came from dealings with the fastow partnerships . such profits may be legal under accounting rules , but there are good reasons to doubt how real they are .
in fact , the accounting rule makers are even now pondering a question that may be important to enron . the body charged with dealing with new accounting issues got a rush question on oct . 23 - - the day before enron ousted mr . fastow - - about the accounting on transactions at a hypothetical ' ' big energy corporation ' ' where one subsidiary , a natural gas pipeline company , trades with another subsidiary , an energy trading entity . the question posed was whether a company can report profits made by one subsidiary while ignoring the losses of the other one . that company may or may not be enron .
such games will not work anymore , at least for enron . it needs to be acquired because its customers are not willing to believe even its revised numbers .

surest steps , not the swiftest , are propelling dynegy past enron

the tortoise appears ready to overtake the hare .
until they confirmed yesterday that they were in merger talks , the enron corporation and dynegy inc . were rivals within the new , rapidly evolving deregulated power industry . each embodied a sharply different approach to making money , attracting investors and winning over regulators .
enron thrived on risk , hurling itself into projects and businesses largely untested by others , earning along the way a reputation for innovation and the acclaim of the investors and analysts who now so angrily shun it because of its murky accounting .
dynegy is the slower , more cautious company , the younger sibling that carefully gleaned lessons from the example set by a brasher enron . dynegy ' s steady progress has now made it strong and solvent enough to contemplate a multibillion - dollar takeover of its erstwhile competitor .
as one senior energy industry executive said , ' ' enron ' s trying to hit more triples and home runs , while dynegy tries for singles and doubles . ' '
kenneth lay , the enron chairman and chief executive who built an empire from two troubled gas pipeline companies - - and whose influential friends include president bush - - is the one who points to the bleachers . dynegy ' s chairman and chief executive , charles l . watson , is less well known but is well respected among stock analysts . he also started small , nurturing his energy trading and generating company - - which had $ 33 billion in revenue for the nine months ended sept . 30 - - from a natural gas trading concern he began in the mid - 80 ' s .
when electricity markets around the united states were deregulated , the companies followed clearly divergent paths . utilities no longer necessarily generated power , and they and their larger industrial clients looked for good deals on the power being sold on the new wholesale markets for electricity . enron and dynegy traded and marketed energy . yet enron sold most of the power plants it owned and focused mainly on financial transactions rather than the actual physical delivery of power , a strategy that made the company a lot of money very fast .
dynegy bought power plants instead and focused on being a reliable supplier of energy . it cashed in , too , on deregulation , but not as enron had . it stuck to its core energy business as its archrival branched into overseas operations , retail power marketing , a water business and a broadband venture , most of which have gone badly awry .
mr . watson said in an interview earlier this year that a string of power plant acquisitions had kept his company diversified and balanced . ' ' we need a little bit everywhere , ' ' he said . ' ' enron is a financial player , but dynegy is more of a physical player . ' '
if enron ' s finances grew more confusing , dynegy seemed to offer clarity . if enron promised a lot , analysts said , dynegy played up its accomplishments . enron lobbied regulators and politicians very publicly , while dynegy kept things quiet and discreet .
' ' chuck watson is a pretty straight - talking guy , ' ' said christopher r . ellinghaus , a williams capital group analyst .
because enron had such extravagant earnings promises to fulfill , some analysts said , it may have been tempted to hide its problems and losses with creative accounting . while dynegy avoided such a path , no one really expects mr . watson to gloat about his company ' s new , larger stature . enron may have been less a hare than a canary in the deregulation coal mine , and it is unclear who will take on that role now .
' ' dynegy had what could be called a second - mover advantage , ' ' said andre meade , head of commerzbank securities ' united states utility research . ' ' it seemed to be content to watch its larger rival up the street in houston , enron , go into a market . and if it was successful , dynegy then could go in with less money and make it work . ' '

enron admits to overstating profits by about $ 600 million

the enron corporation yesterday sliced more than half a billion dollars from its reported profits over the last five years , but its crosstown rival , dynegy inc . , still appeared to be willing to acquire enron , executives close to the merger talks said .
worries about how bond rating agencies would react to the merger delayed announcement of the deal , the executives said . but the failure to announce a deal - - as well as the profit restatement - - caused enron ' s share price to fall . and volume in its core north american natural gas and electricity trading operation plunged 20 percent as other energy - trading companies , unnerved by enron ' s financial distress , steered business elsewhere .
the boards of the two companies tentatively agreed late wednesday night to a deal in which dynegy would acquire enron for about $ 8 billion in stock , or roughly $ 10 a share .
the deal would include an initial $ 1 . 5 billion cash infusion from chevrontexaco , which owns 27 percent of dynegy , and later an additional infusion of $ 1 billion .
the sticking point to proceeding with the deal , according to the executives , is whether enron ' s credit rating will be reduced to ' ' junk ' ' status by the major credit rating agencies in reaction to enron ' s disclosures and its plan to be acquired by dynegy .
dynegy and enron have provided pro forma statements of what a combined dynegy - enron would look like and asked standard & poor ' s and moody ' s investors service for an ' ' expedited review ' ' of the transaction .
dynegy and chevrontexaco are also privately considering whether to offer a bigger cash infusion to buoy enron ' s credit rating - - now just two notches from falling below investment grade - - if the agencies look askance at the current deal . the companies are hoping for a response within the next day or two , the executives said .
the executives also said dynegy was seeking further protections that would allow it to back out of the deal if new , adverse disclosures surfaced .
shares of dynegy rose sharply yesterday , although it was not clear whether buyers believed that the company - - one - quarter the size of enron , in terms of revenues - - was getting a bargain or that enron ' s latest disclosures would lead to the deal ' s being abandoned . dynegy rose $ 3 . 50 , or 10 . 6 percent , to $ 36 . 50 , gaining back all of the ground lost on wednesday after news of the deal leaked . enron shares fell 64 cents , or 7 . 1 percent , to $ 8 . 41 . less than a year ago , enron traded for more than $ 84 a share , and the company was valued at nearly $ 70 billion .
in a sweeping restatement of its profits , enron said that its actual net income for the years 1997 to 2000 was $ 591 million less than it had reported on its financial statements . in a filing with the s . e . c . , enron also indicated that part of last year ' s reported profits came from transactions with partnerships controlled by andrew s . fastow , who was the company ' s chief financial officer until he was ousted oct . 24 .
enron said the transactions involving mr . fastow , which are part of the s . e . c . investigation , earned the former executive more than $ 30 million . the company also said it had fired its treasurer and the general counsel of one of its divisions , who both had invested in one of the partnerships .
any deal would also face long and complex reviews by federal and state energy regulators , who would have to sort out a range of competitive issues in the still - young business of wholesale natural gas and electricity trading . among the agencies involved would be the federal energy regulatory commission , the federal trade commission and the justice department .
some analysts expressed hope that enron ' s financial straits would encourage regulators to clear any deal , to relieve government officials of the prospect of dealing with the potential collapse of the nation ' s dominant energy - trading company . enron handles about a quarter of all power trading , and higher proportions in some important regional markets .
' ' if not for the dire condition of enron today , we are not certain an enron - dynegy merger would be possible due to antitrust concerns , ' ' said christopher r . ellinghaus , an analyst at williams capital . ' ' however , the effective industry bailout that the merger would represent would probably lead to some leniency from the f . t . c . , and would probably be looked at with some relief by the f . e . r . c . ' '
it was clear yesterday there would be opposition to the deal . ' ' if dynegy and enron were to get together , obviously the thing that would appeal to dynegy would be to combine the trading function of the two entities , and that in itself would provide greater market power , not less market power , ' ' said raymond plank , chairman of the apache corporation , one of the largest independent natural gas producers , based in houston .
mr . plank said he hoped regulators would take a critical look at any deal . ' ' the thing they should take a look at is the concentration of market power that has led to excessive volatility , and as a result , once again is threatening north american gas producers . ' '
enron ' s restated profits almost wiped out its net income in 1997 , and reduced it for every year since . but the changes actually raised its reported profits so far this year by $ 5 million .
the changes came largely from including results of two special purpose partnerships that it had treated as being independent - - companies called jedi and chewco , after characters in the ' ' star wars ' ' movies - - and of including a subsidiary of a partnership called ljml . that partnership , and another called ljm 2 , were run by mr . fastow .
the remainder of the earnings reductions , totaling $ 92 million from 1997 through 2000 , came from what enron called ' ' prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications , ' ' which appear to have been changes previously recommended by arthur andersen , enron ' s auditors , but not made because the auditors were persuaded the amounts were immaterial . details of those charges were not disclosed , and enron said it might further alter its reporting as a special board committee continues its investigation of the partnership transactions .
' ' this is an unfortunate situation , ' ' said david tabolt , a spokesman for arthur andersen , which audited enron ' s books in all the years in question . ' ' issues have surfaced that have caused the company to restate its financial statements and advise investors that they should not rely on enron ' s financial statements or our audit reports . we are cooperating with the company and its special committee to bring resolution to these matters . ' '
while the restated financial statements consolidated the results of two partnerships and the ljml subsidiary , they did not fold the entire ljml partnership or the ljm 2 partnership into enron ' s financials . it is not clear how those partnerships performed . nor did they include some other related entities whose enron - guaranteed debts have aroused concern among investors .
mr . fastow , enron ' s former chief financial officer , could not be reached for comment , his lawyer said .
enron ' s downward cascade began after it reported third - quarter earnings on oct . 16 . its share price rose 67 cents , to $ 33 . 84 , that day , as the company said its ' ' recurring net income ' ' had met analyst expectations , even though write - offs led to a net loss .
in a conference call that day , kenneth l . lay , enron ' s chairman , mentioned that the company had written down shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion as it closed out its relationships with the ljm partnerships . in the following days , that figure became widely discussed as some investors concluded that the company had suffered a large loss that it was able to avoid reporting on the earnings statement .
but enron said yesterday that reduction should have been only $ 200 million , with the remaining $ 1 billion reduction simply reversing prior errors made in 2000 and early this year .
enron said it had set up procedures to monitor transactions with the ljm partnerships and assure they were proper . ' ' whether these controls were properly implemented ' ' is being investigated by the special board committee , the company said . that committee has retained william mclucas , a former director of enforcement for the s . e . c . , as well as accountants from deloitte kristina mordaunt , the general counsel of an enron division ; and kathy lynn , vice president of an enron division . the company said ms . lynn no longer worked for enron and that the company was ' ' terminating the employment ' ' of the other two .
some industry officials said yesterday that a deal with dynegy was increasingly looking like a do - or - die prospect for enron , as other energy - trading companies began to back away from the company and take their business to other trading companies . while enron has a large network of natural gas pipelines and other profitable assets , by far its most valuable franchise is its energy - trading business in north america , which acts as an intermediary in more gas and electricity trades than any other company .
yesterday , volume in that business dropped 20 percent . an enron spokesman said company traders attributed the drop to concerns about the s . e . c . investigation and the outcome of the merger talks with dynegy .
enron also canceled a planned meeting with its creditors today in houston , executives said . the agenda for the meeting had been an extension of its $ 3 billion credit lines , but the merger talks superseded that discussion .

houston , nov . 9 ( bloomberg ) - - dynegy inc . ' s plan to buy
rival energy trader enron corp . has stalled pending a credit
review by moody ' s investors service , people familiar with the
talks said . dynegy will probably walk away if enron receives a
` ` junk ' ' credit rating , the people said .
the proposed takeover , for about $ 8 billion in stock , hit a
snag because of the threat of a downgrade that would trigger a
cash crisis by forcing enron to repay $ 3 . 3 billion of bonds early .
moody ' s and standard & poor ' s are considering lowering their
ratings , which are two levels above junk .
a rating below investment - grade would make it ` ` difficult if
not impossible to raise new debt and would severely hamper their
ability to trade , ' ' jefferies analysts see it poised to profit

merger discussions between dynegy and enron corp . continued thursday as wall street had a mixed reaction to a possible combination of the two houston energy traders .
investors traded up dynegy ' s shares , while several stock analysts raised questions .
sources told the chronicle wednesday that the two companies were in advanced talks for the smaller dynegy to buy out its troubled rival . a stock deal likely to be worth $ 7 billion to $ 8 billion was being discussed .
in addition , chevrontexaco corp . , which owns about 27 percent of dynegy , could give enron an immediate infusion of $ 1 . 5 billion to help stabilize its finances and keep its core trading business running smoothly .
dynegy , the people said , was offering a modest premium over enron ' s stock price , but enron had been pressing for a higher offer .
shares in enron closed at $ 9 . 67 tuesday , $ 9 . 05 wednesday and $ 8 . 41 thursday .
each company issued a statement thursday saying the two were in discussions about "" a possible business combination . "" neither plans additional comments until a deal is struck or the talks fail .
the statements came as enron said it is restating its finances as far back as 1997 to include losses related to a number of complex partnerships it created , including several being investigated by federal securities regulators .
enron has been under heavy fire since oct . 16 , when it released third - quarter earnings that included losses related to two investment partnerships formerly run by its since - replaced chief financial officer .
carol coale , an analyst with prudential securities in houston , is to meet with top dynegy executives today .
she has a number of questions about a possible merger , including why dynegy wants to buy enron when its best resource , its people , could cross the street and turn in r ? sum ? s .
she also wonders why ken lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , is apparently willing to sell enron at such a low price .
"" what does he know that we don ' t know ? "" coale asked .
but coale also got the sense dynegy executives are doing their homework and moving with caution , which she said is positive .
a dynegy buyout of enron has the potential to be "" highly accretive "" to dynegy ' s bottom line depending on the price paid , said ronald barone , an analyst at ubs warburg in new york .
"" the new company would be a global powerhouse , "" he said . "" there are significant synergies that can be realized to enhance value . ""
shares in dynegy closed up $ 3 . 50 thursday to $ 36 . 50 .
investors liked two opposite prospects , said jeff dietert , an analyst with simmons & co . international in houston .
on the one hand , investors see potential for dynegy to add profits by buying enron , he said . but if no deal happens , they also see a chance for dynegy to take business away from a weakened enron .
he expects any deal dynegy signs to give it an escape if the securities and exchange commission should conclude enron acted illegally .
government regulators would have to review a merger , looking to see if too much market concentration would result .
with a merger , dynegy would increase its trading and marketing share in the north american natural gas market from about 6 percent to about 21 percent , said john olson , an analyst with sanders harris morris in houston .
for electricity , dynegy ' s numbers would go from about 6 percent to about 23 percent , he said .
andre meade , an analyst with commerzbank securities in new york , doesn ' t believe regulators would find a market concentration problem .
"" it ' s a pretty fractionalized industry with plenty of competition , "" he said .
meade called an enron - dynegy merger "" a mixed bag , "" as it would let dynegy cut costs and lead the energy trading market .
"" however , i don ' t think it ' s as easy as it sounds , "" he said , adding that a successful merger would take the correct incentives to convince enron ' s traders to work for the new company .
"" whenever you merge with or buy a human - capital - based business , it ' s risky . ""

do the sustained bear raids on enron corp . portend chaotic conditions in the energy markets ? that is the $ 64 - billion question . bearish stock markets are the indispensable scavengers of capitalism . they clean up the financial and economic landscape and kill off disease - carrying pests . true believers in free markets should rejoice when bears rush in after a prolonged period of misbehaviour has fouled the financial environment .
those of us who thought the energy industry would escape the great technology bear market may have been too complacent . in recent weeks , the biggest loser on the new york stock exchange has not been a tech stock , but enron , a component of the dow jones utilities index . enron ' s high was $ 89 . 06 a share , and as recently as august it was trading at $ 45 . in recent weeks , enron ' s shares have plunged , closing last week below $ 12 . 33 that collapse has sent shock waves through the capital markets . what may be even more significant for energy producers and users is the valuation of enron ' s bonds : they are trading at distressed prices , offering yields comparable to junk bonds . the ratings services have turned highly negative on enron , although they still rate it an investment - grade credit .
( i regret - - oh how i regret ! - - that i must disclose before proceeding further that investment funds i manage have , at this writing , exposure to enron stock , acquired at prices substantially above current markets . )
for canadians unfamiliar with enron and its place in u . s . energy markets , here is an introduction : voltaire summed up the entire 18 th - century deistic proof of the existence of god by saying , "" if god did not exist , it would be necessary to invent him . "" it ' s the same with enron . u . s . energy markets needed a prime mover . prior to enron , these markets ( other than crude oil ) were relatively primitive and inefficient . neither producers nor consumers had means to hedge their risks effectively , and long - term contracts were made - - if at all - - under circumstances of grossly inadequate information .
the futures market for natural gas was spotty and unreliable , and no futures market for electricity existed . enter enron . in the past half - dozen years , enron became the greatest trading house for energy in the world . its willingness to make markets in energy futures in almost any amount transformed the markets for electric power and gave natural gas producers and consumers reliable hedging and financing opportunities , day in , day out .
by putting its own capital on the line to make trades , enron created depth , liquidity and transparency in energy markets . so active were those markets that they gave price signals to all who would follow them . conspicuous among those who didn ' t were the policy - makers in california . had gov . gray davis and his top officials followed the developments in electricity futures , they would have realized the real nature of the risks facing consumers in the golden state . instead , they let a crisis develop , and then locked in long - term purchase contracts at all - time record - high prices just before they collapsed to normal levels .
by some estimates , enron is on one side or the other of 25 per cent of all outstanding futures contracts in natural gas and electricity . since these contracts extend years ahead , and since the other parties to those trades are relying on enron ' s ability to cover its obligations , the risks to energy prices and supplies could be enormous if enron were to default .
that still seems extremely improbable . contracts executed through the public futures markets have the financial protection of those exchanges for enron ' s "" counterparties "" ( the term for the other side of a futures contract ) . but enron has enormous exposure through direct deals that have no such protection .
what has hammered enron ' s securities lately is the unfolding story of gigantic off - balance - sheet deals the company made with partnerships that included , astonishingly enough , the chief financial officer , who was finally forced to go on leave . these partnership deals were never really disclosed , except in obscure balance sheet notes that gave no indication of the scale of the deals or that a senior company officer was involved .
why should investors who aren ' t owners of enron stock or bonds care ? because the past year has seen the biggest swings in natural gas and electricity prices in history , and some observers wonder whether enron ' s internal problems exacerbated those swings . worse , if enron has to withdraw from the markets , what about the billions in forward hedging contracts that producers and consumers have in place ? many u . s . energy producers locked in high prices by making huge forward sales . if those contracts are voided , defaults could spread through the system , throwing energy markets into chaos .
there were enough problems in the energy - short u . s . even when enron was keeping the markets functioning . if the master market maker goes down , or is forced to curtail its operations , this winter could be a truly chilling experience for north americans . when bush and cheney aren ' t worrying about bin laden or anthrax , they may be worrying about enron .

this year ' s earnings were marginally increased but the company ' s third - quarter loss widened marginally from $ 618 m to $ 635 m .
in the securities and exchange commission filing , enron also announced the dismissal of two more officials : ben glisan , the company ' s treasurer , and kristina mordaunt , general counsel for one division .
enron ran into trouble on october 16 , when it announced a $ 1 . 2 bn reduction of shareholders ' equity and a $ 1 . 01 bn charge .
yesterday ' s filing goes some way to explaining how the charge came about . enron attributed the charge to dealings with ljm , a private equity fund run by andrew fastow , formerly enron chief financial officer .
private equity investments have injected enormous volatility into the earnings of companies , such as jp morgan chase . keeping ljm off the balance sheet allowed enron to avoid major swings . but to prevent ljm being consolidated , enron had to own less than half of the special - purpose vehicle , and for outside investors to participate they had to be compensated .
what that meant was that when the value of enron ' s private equity investments fell below a certain level , people familiar with enron ' s balance sheet said , co - investors would receive enron stock .
the enron filing reveals that the ljm losses arose from another group of special - purpose entities , known as the raptor vehicles , which were designed in part to hedge an enron investment in a bankrupt broadband company , rhythm netconnections .
the $ 1 . 2 bn reduction in shareholders ' equity arose from the termination of the raptor hedging arrangements , which if they had continued would have resulted in enron issuing 58 m shares to offset the company ' s private equity losses .
enron also revealed that mr fastow was paid in excess of $ 30 m as a result of his role in running ljm .
at issue is whether mr fastow was acting in the best interests of other enron shareholders .
the filing also raises questions about enron ' s cash flow , which will be studied carefully by the rating agencies and creditors .
a group of banks , including barclays bank , credit suisse first boston , deutsche bank , jp morgan chase and citigroup , have lent more than $ 4 bn to enron over the last weeks , much of it not collateralised .
by reducing its earnings by more than $ 100 m for several years , enron has created concern about its ability to service debt . on the balance sheet , enron owes $ 12 . 8 bn . off - balance - sheet entities related to enron owe $ 8 bn - $ 9 bn . enron generates about $ 3 bn cashflow annually , but despite claiming to be cashflow - positive , its borrowings rose significantly last year .

the stock market downturn and well publicised cases of corporate mismanagement , including this month ' s enron controversy , have made investors increasingly wary of such pro - management stances .

the companies with the highest - or most pro - management - scores in 1990 included gte , waste management , general re , the limited , ncr , kmart , united telecommunications , time warner , rorer and woolworth .
from 1990 to 1999 , the first group outperformed the standard & poor ' s 500 by 3 . 5 percentage points each year from 1990 to 1999 , the second group trailed the index by about 5 points . an investor who bought the pro - shareholder stocks and sold short the pro - management stocks could have captured that 8 . 5 per cent difference .
the study also found that the pro - management companies had lower sales growth and less profits than other firms in their industry .
however , mr metrick stresses that the findings do not prove causation . strong management provisions do not necessarily undermine stock performance , nor do shareholder rights always lead to better returns .
"" what we do know is that companies that gave shareholders rights did better than those that didn ' t in the 1990 s . . . so maybe if the companies that don ' t give shareholder rights gave them , their stock would do a lot better going forward , "" he said . "" maybe investors should be looking for that change . but that is the question the paper doesn ' t answer . ""

the problem is that enron ' s business is not the standard trading business . all conventional methodology , such as the various value - at - risk systems , or jp morgan ' s riskmetrics , assumes liquid , continuous markets , where it is possible to measure historic price volatility and implied price volatility . but the over - the - counter gas and electricity markets that are enron ' s core business involve long - term contracts , lumpy regional sub - markets , and unstable volatility measures . as one top wall street derivatives manager says "" these require scenario analyses rather than var . ""
the valuation problem is complicated by enron ' s gigantic market share , far larger than the largest institutions have in the government bond , currency , or exchange traded commodities markets .
even so , it is likely that enron ' s long and short positions do balance , as the company says , even though the revenue recognition and profitability may need tuning . the company ' s earnings and balance sheet restatement was reassuring , in that there was no restatement of the balance sheet or income statement in the trading business . dynegy ' s due diligence team and the arthur anderson auditors working on enron ' s books know they had better get it right .
if dynegy had announced a package of asset purchases rather than a stock deal , you could have wondered whether they saw value in enron as a going concern . that means keeping the trading business going , although probably running it more carefully and transparently . also , this is probably a "" once in a corporate lifetime "" opportunity to put together a merger of such large companies with the likely quick approval of antitrust regulators . there was no chance that the federal reserve or any other government entity would or could step in to assume responsibility for liquidity in the traded energy markets . the fed ' s giving a pass on antitrust considerations is a low - cost way to head off any problem .
and enron ' s pipelines , gas storage business , power plants , liquefied natural gas facilities , and other physical assets would be difficult to duplicate . they would sell for a significant premium to the book value on which the bondholders have first call .
so enron ' s $ 13 bn of debt is most likely a good buy , and you are getting it at close to bankruptcy prices . it is probably a good idea to leave the bet on the takeover price of the equity to the professional risk arbs .

enron in crisis - lure of number - one spot sparks interest .

dynegy ' s interest in enron was no doubt sparked by the chance to steal its houston - based neighbour ' s position as the number - one natural gas and power marketer in the us .
"" the potential is staggering . if the companies combined , they would create a $ 21 bn behemoth in the energy sector with unparallelled energy - marketing skills and financial resources , "" says christopher ellinghaus , an analyst at williams capital group .
dynegy ' s gas business is currently less than half the size of enron ' s , and also trails duke and mirant . it is only one - eighth as big as enron in power trading , where aep , mirant , duke , el paso and reliant also hold big positions .
like enron , dynegy has been a market favourite , exploiting growth opportunities in the unregulated and rapidly developing wholesale natural gas and electricity markets in the us .
it has also been looking to expand its wholesale operations well beyond a uk presence .
dynegy ' s online trading platform , dynegydirect - which helped raise the company ' s recent third - quarter earnings 22 per cent to $ 286 m - is seen as a good fit with enron online . the two platforms allow customers to buy wholesale gas liquids at the click of a mouse .
there are other links . chuck watson , dynegy chief executive , is a friend of jeff skilling , who quit as enron chief executive officer in august . dynegy is also an important trading partner for enron , demonstrated by the fact that enron has helped bail out its new suitor in the past from potential trading losses .
that counterparty relationship may give dynegy a powerful incentive to preserve enron in order to maintain stability in the energy markets . analysts say there would be a big shake - up in the energy markets were enron to fail , although some say the volatility may be only short term . a takeover would not be the only way for rivals such as dynegy to capitalise on enron ' s weakness , however . dynegy , el paso and duke energy are already assessing potential opportunities to pick up enron ' s share of the market should it disappear . many are trading partners with enron , and some , like aquila , have been reducing their exposure as counterparties as the enron crisis deepens .
however , any dynegy takeover of enron would invite close regulatory scrutiny . most analysts believe a deal could be done , but approval could take more than a year due to market issues and the complexity of the two companies .
some analysts said a deal might be perceived as a necessary bail - out for the trading industry , and therefore welcomed by the federal trade commission and the federal energy regulatory commission .
others , however , raised serious concerns about the prospect of a bid by dynegy . although dynegy had told investors it was ready to make large acquisitions or mergers in the us and overseas , they had not expected such a transforming deal . mr watson told analysts in october that he was considering deals which could add generation assets , gas pipeline and storage infrastructure , entire utilities and communication assets .
carol coale , an analyst at prudential securities , says there would be other concerns surrounding any deal with enron .
"" strategically and culturally , the companies do not fit well together , "" she says , adding that enron has been moving to offload units while dynegy has preferred to hang on to assets .
carol levenson at gimme credit . com , an independent provider of credit research , says dynegy would be taking "" a big risk "" to its credit ratings by even being associated with enron ' s liabilities : "" dynegy is utterly dependent on its credit ratings and the confidence of the market and its trading partners to do business profitably . ""
analysts took some comfort , however , in the possible involvement of the newly merged chevrontexaco , which owns a 27 per cent stake in dynegy . additional reporting by andrew edgecliffe - johnson .

copyright ? 2000 dow jones it would also would have a spill - over effect on other energy traders if investors backed away from the entire sector .
the 50 to 100 large counter - parties that do business with enron daily could continue to trade without the market ' s biggest participant and even its trading platform ; telephone trading remains a substantial part of the business . but without enron , a liquidity crisis would probably ensue , disrupting energy markets and undermining business for many of its competitors .
"" there ' s a fair amount of incentive for counter - parties to hang in there and not contribute directly into pushing ( enron ) over the brink , "" says christine uspenski , energy analyst at schwab capital markets .
so the majority has chosen stability over a bigger share of what would surely become a riskier market . they have continued to do business with enron on much the same terms they had before october 16 , when enron disclosed a surprise balance sheet adjustment that brought to the fore long - simmering questions about its transparency .
analysts had long advised investors to look past those questions . after all , with the launch of enron ' s online platform in 1999 , trading volumes had soared as the number of products traded over the internet grew to almost 2 , 000 , ranging from weather derivatives to coal . enron ' s revenue more than doubled to $ 101 bn from 1999 to 2000 .
many admitted they were unsure how enron made its money . not only had the company so dramatically transformed itself from a traditional pipeline company but it had moved increasingly into unsupervised areas that made it harder to scrutinise enron ' s finances .
"" it became a new age holding company , "" says paul kedrosky , who teaches strategy and corporate governance at the university of british columbia . "" as long as the company performed , people were willing to forgive what was obviously horrific disclosure . ""
those people included not only share market investors but also those in the business of buying and selling energy commodities . they needed goods and enron delivered more natural gas and electricity than anyone else , often at better prices . it was the first stop for utilities who lacked sufficient generation facilities to keep the lights on for their customers .
they would go to the open market and purchase electricity , much of the time from enron . those that use natural gas to power their generation facilities obtained that through the open market as well . many have locked themselves into long - term contracts with enron that they cannot get out of - and they would be the ones with most to lose if enron went under .
but those who were originally most spooked by the prospect of business without enron - the energy traders - seem to have accepted the reality that enron will most likely never dominate the markets as it had in the past .
analysts and traders say the trading markets themselves have remained stable throughout enron ' s troubles even as the risk of uncertainty has increased . "" no one knows their positions or how they ' re hedged in the market , or how they might have to cover their positions , "" one energy trader said yesterday .
even though enron had been hailed as the innovator in building these markets to their current state of sophistication , it has been forced over the past few weeks to act increasingly like a newcomer .
however , analysts say some of enron ' s partners in the us and europe are demanding enron provide evidence of the availability of cash or security that can be called on quickly .
enron ' s main competitors are now able offer better prices , and - while still not openly seeking to undermine enron - are undercutting its business as they report new customers and higher volumes . but , so far , no major counter - party has changed its terms with the company . "" out of respect for enron ' s presence , my sense is the industry has tried to give them the benefit of the doubt to see if they can resolve this situation , "" says michael zimmer , of law firm baker & mckenzie . see lex .

front page - companies & markets - enron rescue deal talks drag on - us energy group forced to restate accounts since 1997 .
enron , the us energy group , was yesterday forced to restate its accounts since 1997 as it scrambled to prevent its confidence crisis turning into financial meltdown .
expectations of an early announcement of a rescue deal between enron and dynegy , a rival group , were dashed as talks dragged on through yesterday morning in houston .
enron said it was terminating the employment of its treasurer and the general counsel of one of its divisions , both of whom , it said , were involved in limited partnerships that conducted off - balance - sheet deals with enron .
enron , a stock market star until this year , is fighting to restore the confidence of investors , creditors , customers and regulators following last month ' s ill - explained decision to reduce shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 bn ( # 820 m ) to meet off - balance - sheet obligations .
it tried to clarify the situation yesterday by laying out the accounting basis for the shareholder equity reduction and providing more information about the limited partnerships formed by andy fastow , enron ' s former chief financial officer .
enron said it believed mr fastow , who was replaced last month , had received "" in excess of $ 30 m "" relating to his management and investment activities in the partnerships .
the group said it and its auditors had also decided some off - balance entities should have been included in its prior financial statements .
"" we believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the sec ( securities and exchange commission ) about these matters , "" said ken lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , yesterday , adding that the group would continue to respond to investors ' requests for information .
the group ' s banks , due to meet today , want to secure $ 3 . 3 bn in unsecured credit lines drawn down in the past month . but they may not be able to renegotiate the terms unless enron ' s situation worsens sufficiently to trigger a default . jp morgan chase and citigroup , which have made $ 1 bn in secured loans to enron , are also understood to want to syndicate them to spread the risk , as nervousness increases .
in a regulatory filing , enron said it had restated accounts from 1997 to the third quarter of this year , leading to an increase of $ 628 m in debt for the year 2000 , and changes in net income up to the third quarter of this year .
enron ' s stock fell a further 5 per cent in morning trading - to $ 8 . 61 - and stands at barely a tenth of its level at the end of last year . the group ' s bonds rose only 4 points to 78 cents in the dollar reflecting scepticism about a rescue deal with dynegy . lex , page 22 enron in crisis , page 27 .

enron
enron has provided the securities and exchange commission with some more detail on concerns it had raised over the last three weeks , while the stock has declined 70 per cent . the $ 1 . 2 bn equity charge relates to losses in ljm , the off - balance sheet private equity fund run by andrew fastow , its former chief financial officer . these , in turn , arise from a group of special purpose entities that ljm used to hedge risk associated with enron ' s investment in a bankrupt broadband company . the charges resulted when the hedges were closed . all clear , then ?
what emerges from the filing is an off - balance sheet mess of interlinking financing vehicles . the difficulty in unravelling it might be part of the reason why jp morgan chase and salomon smith barney insisted that their last loan should be secured with assets . no doubt other lenders would like similar security . more clearly , enron admits that three unconsolidated entities should have been consolidated . that means the earnings statements over the last five years were worthless . enron has now reduced net income by a cumulative $ 600 m for 1997 - 2000 , not the kind of thing that reassures ratings agencies . mr fastow ' s resignation will leave him with more time to spend with the $ 30 m he received for running the ljm partnerships .
it is hardly surprising that talks with dynegy about a capital injection have dragged on . would it really be wise for dynegy to take on risk that remains very hard to assess and to put its own debt rating in jeopardy ? enron might look cheap , but the stock has collapsed for good reason .

energy trading giant enron corp . disclosed yesterday that it had overstated its earnings by $ 567 million since 1997 , and it fired two more company officials as questions continued to be raised over how much further the company ' s free fall may go .
enron ' s stock has plummeted and energy companies have avoided doing business with it since enron disclosed last month that its obligations to several partnerships involving company officials had reduced its shareholders ' equity by $ 1 . 2 billion . enron is facing a cash crunch , analysts said . its credit rating has been slashed and if it falls to junk - bond status , the company would have to make accelerated payments on $ 3 . 4 billion in debt held by the partnerships .
as enron made its disclosures yesterday , dynegy inc . , enron ' s smaller houston - based competitor , continued to study a possible $ 8 billion acquisition of enron .
a rescue by dynegy and chevrontexaco corp . , a major dynegy shareholder , could provide enron with $ 1 . 2 billion in cash , according to sources familiar with the negotiations . dynegy also would take on $ 12 . 8 billion in enron debt , the sources said .
enron , the nation ' s largest trader of electric power and natural gas , said earnings from 1997 through the first six months of this year should have totaled $ 2 . 9 billion , not the $ 3 . 5 billion that it had declared . enron blamed the reduction on investment losses in private partnerships that it says were not properly accounted for .
it also fired treasurer ben glisan and a division general counsel , saying it believed they had made personal investments in some of these partnerships , whose activities have led to conflict of interest accusations by shareholders against senior enron officials and board members .
the new disclosures were made to the securities and exchange commission , which is investigating the partnerships . they also were published on enron ' s web site .
the firings follow enron ' s dismissal of chief financial officer andrew fastow , who until july had also directed some of the largest of these partnerships with the approval of enron ' s board . enron said fastow made more than $ 30 million from two of these partnerships .
using capital from enron and private investors , the partnerships purchased power plants and other assets from enron with the intention of selling them , a key to enron ' s corporate strategy of concentrating on trading energy rather than producing it .
dynegy confirmed yesterday that it was in talks with enron about an acquisition , but did not comment further . industry analysts believe that dynegy is driving a hard bargain , seeking protection against the possibility of further disclosures of financial problems by enron , and against the growing number of lawsuits by enron shareholders . dynegy "" has the chips , "" said brian youngberg , an analyst with edward jones in st . louis .
another possible outcome could be a major investment in enron by dynegy and potentially other energy companies , if the right collateral can be found , sources said .
one question is whether a dynegy acquisition of enron would face a drawn - out regulatory and antitrust review that could block enron ' s chances of recovering .
"" dynegy and enron together are two of the biggest players in the trading space . it ' s a great concentration of power , "" said raymond plank , chairman of apache corp . , a houston natural gas producer . "" we don ' t see any advantage to that . ""
if the dynegy deal is approved , the purchase price would come to just over $ 10 per share , based on current market values . in august 2000 , enron ' s stock hit $ 90 a share , but the price fell steadily from that peak and has plummeted in the weeks since the losses from its partnership deals were disclosed . enron ' s stock closed yesterday at $ 8 . 41 , down 64 cents .
enron handles about one - quarter of all energy trades , quoting prices and buying and selling commodities . while some of these transactions set the price of oil , natural gas , electricity other energy products , far more commonly the trades are financial deals between traders speculating on energy prices , or companies seeking insurance to limit the costs of energy purchases .
energy companies and trading firms are working to reduce their vulnerability if enron were to fail .
"" the inability to quantify possible risks is causing people to stay at arms length from enron now , "" said louis b . gagliardi , an analyst with john s . herold inc .
plank said traders "" have been trying to neutralize their books to the impact of a potential failure on enron ' s part . we were able to get out of almost every trade [ involving enron ] . "" not everyone has been able to do it . "" but plank said energy markets are large enough to handle shocks .
"" markets would be pretty volatile in natural gas , power and oil "" if enron had to pull back from trading , gagliardi said . "" but we ' d get back to normal pretty quickly . ""
bond - rating companies have sharply cut their ratings on enron ' s bonds since these disclosures , and its debt is now one step above junk status , by some ratings .
analysts said that if enron ' s bond rating fell below investment grade , they expect it to set in motion a forced sale of enron assets held by the partnerships .
two of the partnerships , named marlin and osprey , have a combined indebtedness of $ 3 . 4 billion , said ralph pellechia , an analyst at fitch inc . , a bond - rating firm . that debt is to investors who purchased assets from enron , including a water system in britain and other holdings .
if enron ' s bond rating crashes , the assets presumably would be sold and enron would have to make up any remaining obligation to debt holders by delivering its stock to the partnerships , pellechia said . given the drop in enron ' s stock price , that might not be possible .
"" we don ' t believe the asset value that supports those partnership trusts at this point in time is fully adequate to pay down the debt , "" he said .
"" obviously there are a lot of options they [ enron officials ] are exploring . we are watching it very closely . ""
http : / / www . washingtonpost . com
copyright ? 2000 dow jones in return , enron took a note receivable , or simply a loan , from raptor for $ 1 . 2 billion .
as it happened , enron benefited massively from the assets hedge . it protected itself against a $ 500 million decline in the assets in 2000 and $ 453 million in 2001 . these hedging gains were netted out to zero in enron core earnings , because they were offset by declines in asset values . but without the hedges , enron would ' ve taken the losses in its expense line .
vince carter
of course , the problem was that raptor , and therefore ljm 2 , was losing from the hedges . that might ' ve been tolerable if raptor were making money from the stock agreement . but enron ' s stock began falling sharply in 2001 , depriving ljm 2 of potential profits . meanwhile , as the stock price slid , enron was having to agree to issue more stock to keep the equity pledge to raptor at $ 1 . 2 billion . as the decline continued into the third quarter , and the issuance commitment grew , it made sense to unwind all the raptor deals with ljm 2 .
at this point , enron took the $ 1 . 2 billion charge to equity in the third quarter to reverse the equity pledge . enron did take some of raptor ' s hedging losses itself , but it did so through a $ 711 million pretax charge , which it chose to exclude from operating earnings in the third quarter .
the big question is whether ljm 2 actually took any losses itself from raptor . why is that crucial ? if enron shielded ljm 2 from losses , it was essentially dealing with itself . the sec and investors wouldn ' t like that . what clues are there that ljm 2 didn ' t take a loss ? well , the thursday press release says that enron bought out ljm 2 ' s stakes in raptor for $ 35 million . that makes little sense . how can ljm 2 have had any raptor equity left after the losses it appears to have sustained ? if enron made ljm 2 whole , then this was all little more than a shell game .
seems like enron still has a whole lot more to tell us .

enron reissues financial reports energy : the company restates four years to clear questions related to a series of controversial partnerships .

enron corp . on thursday reissued its financial statements for the last four years , shaving nearly $ 600 million in profit from what it previously reported .
the action was designed to clear nagging questions about the houston - based energy concern ' s finances stemming from a series of controversial partnerships . those questions have accelerated a free fall in the value of enron shares and have forced it to seek new financing and enter into merger talks with rival dynegy inc .
however , the action still left analysts wondering whether further negative disclosures might be coming .
analysts saw the restatement also as an effort to disclose negative news now , while it is negotiating to be acquired by houston - based dynegy .
both companies confirmed merger talks thursday . some analysts suggested the deal has problems and could pose new risks for dynegy .
enron also said that it fired ben glisan , its treasurer , and kristina mourdant , an attorney with the company . both executives had a financial interest in at least one of the partnerships . in october , enron replaced chief financial officer andrew fastow because of his involvement in the partnerships .
the restatement comes amid a probe by federal regulators into the relationship between several senior enron executives and a series of partnerships created by the energy concern .
"" a massive restatement like this doesn ' t look good . but since enron was already under such scrutiny , it ' s really not much of a surprise , "" said christopher ellinghaus , an analyst with williams capital in new york .
"" this would be very bad news if it had come out after a merger was announced , "" ellinghaus added .
enron shares fell 64 cents thursday to close at $ 8 . 41 , its lowest finish since 1992 and less than 10 % of the nearly $ 90 high the company hit aug . 23 , 2000 . dynegy shares rose $ 3 . 50 to $ 36 . 50 . both trade on the new york stock exchange . .
analysts said enron ran into trouble with its strategy to create partnerships to purchase assets such as fiber - optic lines that enron wanted to move off its books .
although many companies have used similar techniques to improve their balance sheets , the deals are almost always with third parties and private investors rather than company executives . the involvement of executives as investors in these ventures raises the perception of a conflict of interest , said brian youngberg , an analyst with edward jones in st . louis .
the securities and exchange commission had asked for information about the financial transactions between enron and the partnerships , which were approved by enron lawyers and directors .
in essence , the partnerships reduced borrowings enron listed on its balance sheet . they protected its credit rating , helping it to obtain favorable interest rates on its corporate borrowings .
however , after reviewing its accounting for three of the ventures , enron said in an sec filing thursday that it should have included the financial performance of those businesses in its consolidated balance sheet .
the filing included a restatement of enron financial statements for 1997 through 2000 and the first three quarters of 2001 . it said its previous financial documents "" should not be relied upon . ""
enron ' s new assessment of its financial condition slashed its total net income for that nearly four - year period by $ 586 million , or about 20 % , to $ 2 . 3 billion . the biggest change was a $ 250 - million reduction in net income for 1999 .
the enron - dynegy merger talks involve a stock swap valuing enron at about $ 10 a share , or about $ 8 billion , according to sources familiar with the negotiations . chevrontexaco corp . , which owns nearly 27 % of dynegy , would pour $ 1 . 5 billion in cash into enron up front , with $ 1 billion to follow at the close of the transaction .
dynegy would assume $ 12 . 8 billion in enron debt , which does not include the off - balance - sheet partnerships , the sources said .
enron chairman and chief executive kenneth l . lay would remain on the board of the merged company but would not have day - to - day responsibilities , the sources said .
dynegy chairman and chief executive chuck watson would assume those jobs at the combined company , and dynegy president stephen bergstrom would become president , they said .
there is no guarantee that an agreement will be reached , and if it is , such a merger would face a lengthy and difficult review by federal regulators . the potential merger would have its problems , some analysts said .
dynegy risks losing enron ' s most important asset , its energy traders , who can easily migrate to other energy trading firms in the houston area , said andre meade , head of u . s . utilities research for commerzbank securities .
dynegy , like enron , needs a good credit rating and the ability to sell assets and issue stock to conduct its trading businesses , said carol levenson , an analyst with gimmecredit . com . a thumbs - down by the stock market could seriously jeopardize dynegy ' s financial flexibility , she said .
although enron management has repeatedly emphasized that its core energy trading and marketing business remains sound , the company ' s severe cash crunch has hurt . enron ' s online trading operation has lost business in recent days .

new york - - small - capitalization stocks ended lower after retracing solid intraday gains , with the bulk of the selloff taking place in the final hour of trading .
the overall nasdaq market also fell , as investors took profits following the recent run - up of nasdaq ' s large - cap technology components .
both the small - cap market , as measured by the russell 2000 index , and the nasdaq composite index of large and small stocks underperformed the other major stock - market measures .
the russell 2000 fell 1 . 74 , or 0 . 39 % , to 439 . 06 , after posting an intraday gain of 5 . 31 , and the nasdaq composite index , at 1827 . 77 , lost 9 . 76 , or 0 . 53 % , having been up as much as 50 . 86 earlier .
the small - cap market was able to post slimmer declines than the overall nasdaq market because of the strength of financial stocks , which make up the largest industry group in the russell 2000 following technology . the nasdaq bank index rose 0 . 3 % .
visible genetics , a toronto maker of dna - sequencing systems and diagnostic kits that analyze genes linked to diseases , tumbled $ 3 . 21 , or 22 % , $ to 11 . 30 . the company posted a third - quarter loss of 76 cents a share , compared with a year - earlier loss of 63 cents a share .

enron , the debt - stricken energy trading group , could be forced to sell its main british assets under the terms of an $ 8 bn takeover being considered by dynegy , its smaller rival .
the two companies confirmed yesterday that they were in talks about a takeover , which would see houston firm dynegy , about a fifth of the size of its target , pay a "" fire - sale "" price worth about a tenth of enron ' s $ 70 bn value a year ago .
the outcome would be a humiliation for enron , amer ica ' s largest energy trader , which was reportedly the biggest corporate contributor to the republican party and the presidential campaign last year . it has been forlornly courting cash injections from groups such as shell in the past few days to keep it afloat .
enron ' s shares have lost 90 % of their value this year , going into free fall in the past two weeks as it sacked finance director andrew fastow for unusual partnership transactions carried out off - balance sheet . these forced it to take a $ 1 bn charge and cut shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 bn .
two other senior officials , including enron ' s treasurer , were fired yesterday following their involvement in the murky fastow deals , which are being investigated by the securities and exchange commission .
pressure to conclude the deal swiftly ahead of an important meeting today between enron and its creditors mounted as the once dominant energy trader was forced to restate its earnings and substantial debts for the past four years , amid fears its bonds would soon be given junk status .
chevrontexaco , the oil group which owns 27 % of dynegy , would inject up to $ 2 . 5 bn if the deal goes ahead . enron , also based in houston , owns wessex water , for which it paid pounds 1 . 4 bn in 1998 , and gas - fired power stations in britain , including the high - performing 1900 mw teesside plant . it recently announced deals to run the energy management operations of sainsbury and guinness .
dynegy is paying pounds 421 m for bg ' s gas storage business , a deal expected to be concluded next month , but , renowned for its "" stingy "" financial management , it has shied away from buying a series of british power stations on offer because of inflated prices .
copyright ? 2000 dow jones at the end of 2000 , enron ' s debt was $ 10 . 86 billion , $ 628 million more than previously reported .
by not disclosing the debt earlier , enron presumably maintained a stronger credit rating and was able to vastly increase the size of its core operations - trading natural gas and electricity on wholesale markets .
and while enron kept certain details about its finances secret , the company ' s stature as the crown jewel among energy traders grew .
investors from wall street to main street sought a piece of the action as enron reported bigger and bigger profits and executives boasted they would successfully apply their energy trading strategies to other markets as well , including steel and broadband communications .
however , after a decade in which enron firmly established itself as the nation ' s no . 1 natural gas and power marketing company , things have not gone according to plan lately and the former high - flyer has experienced a remarkably fast fall from grace .
enron ' s stock price began a steady descent 10 months ago when its nascent high - speed internet unit failed to live up to the hype . the downward momentum was further propelled by difficulties collecting money from power customers in india .
then , in the past three weeks , enron ' s share price plummeted fast and furiously as the company announced a $ 618 million third quarter loss , ousted its chief financial officer and undertook an apparently fruitless scramble for cash to remain an independent entity .
several news organizations were reporting that dynegy was negotiating to buy enron for $ 8 billion in stock , but that the tentative deal could still fall apart .
besides dynegy , companies mentioned as possible suitors included general electric ' s ge capital unit and royal dutch / shell group .
on thursday , both dynegy and enron released statements confirming they were in talks , but declined to provide any details .
the new york times , the wall street journal and the houston chronicle , among others , reported thursday that dynegy is considering paying about $ 8 billion in stock for enron , citing people familiar with the matter . chevrontexaco corp . , which has a 27 percent stake in dynegy , would provide enron an immediate cash infusion of $ 1 billion , the papers reported .
enron ' s lay would not be given any formal management position in the combined company , although he would have a seat on its board , the journal reported .
enron said it released the revised earnings so that investors could "" appropriately value the strength of our core businesses . ""
"" we believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the sec about these matters , "" said kenneth lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive
the company also fired treasurer ben glisan and a lawyer , kristina mordaunt , on thursday . last month , enron ousted chief financial officer andrew fastow , who was in charge of some of the partnerships being probed by the sec .
jeff skilling , enron ' s former chief executive who left in august , has been called to testify before the sec , although it ' s unclear when .
wall street analysts admitted they were stunned by the rapid demise of enron , but said a merger with dynegy would help improve enron ' s credibility .
still , prudential securities analyst carole coale remained puzzled as to "" why dynegy ' s management would want to take on the uncertainties and potential liabilities associated with a merger with enron . ""
christopher ellinghaus of williams capital in new york said enron ' s accounting "" shenanigans "" are legendary in the industry .
"" i ' m not willing to say it ' s fraud yet , "" ellinghaus said . "" enron just likes to be fancy . they may have been too fancy for their own good . ""
enron said the revised financial statements will include a reduction to net income of about $ 96 million in 1997 , $ 113 million in 1998 , $ 250 million in 1999 and $ 132 million in 2000 , increases of $ 17 million for the first quarter of 2001 and $ 5 million for the second quarter and a reduction of $ 17 million for the third quarter of 2001 .
enron , the nation ' s top buyer and seller of natural gas and the top wholesale marketer in the united states , had become one of the nation ' s 10 largest companies , recording revenue of $ 100 . 8 billion in 2000 .

before its stunning fall from grace , enron corp . was a genuine market darling , with a throng of adoring investors , analysts and academics who held it out as a model of how to turn a sleepy , old economy company into a true star of the fast - paced new economy . even after the puncturing of the market bubble , the critics who had long questioned the texas company ' s aggressive growth strategy and even more aggressive accounting were dismissed as old - fashioned cranks .
now , in no small part because of its executives ' own highhandedness and dismissive treatment of those same investors and analysts , enron ' s reputation is in tatters , the u . s . securities and exchange commission is probing billions of dollars worth of off - balance - sheet transactions , its once high - flying stock has tanked , its bonds are trading at levels usually reserved for troubled junk and the lawsuits are flying thick and fast .
about the only lessons to take away from this fiasco are among the oldest in investing and long espoused by the likes of warren buffett : never buy anything you don ' t understand and don ' t touch a company whose finances are so murky as to defy description .
there ' s no shortage of major companies that appear to believe the less investors know about their true financial state , the better . the dot - bomb rubble is littered with them . they include nortel networks , cisco systems , lucent technologies , amazon . com , jds uniphase , qwest communications , motorola , volkswagen and even starbucks .
in these bearish times , most companies acknowledge , albeit reluctantly , that they would be better off coming clean with the people who have a vested interest in their future .
here is what joe nacchio , defiant boss of troubled qwest , told a conference last month : "" you all think we cheat and lie and steal , obviously , and therefore you trade us at a discount to what a normal company with great revenue and great growth should be traded . . . . we ' ll just let the numbers speak for themselves on oct . 31 . ""
so along comes that fateful day , and we pass the mike over to mr . nacchio : "" some of you will recall that at a recent conference i said the results will speak for themselves . the reality is they do not speak clearly for themselves without some interpretation , given the current economic conditions and the effects of merger and other one - time charges . "" you can guess what happened to qwest ' s credibility and its stock price .
as for houston - based enron , which is in a desperate hunt for liquidity to shore up its vast energy - trading business and keep its credit rating from being slashed below investment grade , the company confirmed yesterday it ' s in talks with smaller cross - town rival dynegy . several published accounts have said the talks involve an immediate cash infusion of up to $ 2 - billion and an eventual merger .
faced with the sec probe and a rash of shareholder lawsuits , enron also revealed that its profit statements since 1997 aren ' t worth anything . the company is restating earnings through the first half of this year , mainly to reflect a $ 1 . 2 - billion ( u . s . ) drop in shareholder equity after the company terminated complex share transactions with certain limited partnerships . the dealings had enabled enron to grow dramatically without having to show a huge whack of debt on its balance sheet , which would have affected its ability to raise capital and hampered its rapid transformation from regional gas pipeline utility to global energy - trading powerhouse .
such transactions are common and practical . but enron ' s were unusually complicated , and the company was roundly assailed for keeping the details to itself .
disclosure has never been this company ' s middle name . the former ceo once used a seven - letter expletive to describe an analyst who had the temerity to ask for a balance sheet during an earnings conference call . but the real stunner was that , unknown to the investing public but with the board ' s apparent approval , two partnerships had been set up , to considerable personal profit , by enron ' s own chief financial officer , andrew faston . he walked the plank on oct . 24 , and the company has been scrambling ever since .
opaque accounting doesn ' t necessarily mean there is any skullduggery afoot . the finances of some companies are devilishly complicated , simply because of the nature of their businesses . and that goes for enron and its massive energy - trading and hedging operations .
but investors should always be looking for as much financial visibility as possible and steering clear of any company that cannot - - or will not - - provide it . bmilner @ globeandmail . ca

the crisis surrounding enron , the beleaguered american energy trading group with power plant and trading investments in britain , deepened yesterday with the dismissal of two key executives alleged to be involved in off - balance - sheet operations now under investigation by regulatory authorities .
ben glisan , managing director and treasurer , and kristina mordaunt , another managing director and lawyer of a subsidiary business , left after internal investigations .
enron said it believed the pair and four other former enron employeers were involved as partners in a limited partnership that had dealings with the company .
the dismissals came as enron considered a "" make or break "" takeover offer from dynergy , another us energy group with uk interests .

enron meets indian lenders on power plant stake sale ( update 3 )

enron meets indian lenders on power plant stake sale ( update 3 )
( adds lender ' s comments in ninth paragraph , detail on idbi ' s
exposure to enron in 11 th . )
singapore , nov . 9 ( bloomberg ) - - enron corp . , the world ' s
largest energy trader , is meeting lenders about its sale of a
stake in a $ 3 billion indian power project as it seeks to raise
cash and forestall a possible credit downgrade .
enron , which lost 89 percent of its market value this year ,
had its long - term credit rating cut as low as one notch above junk
status this week and would have to repay $ 3 . 3 billion in bonds
early if its rating is cut below investment grade .
dynegy inc . , which is in talks to buy enron for about $ 8
billion in stock , is concerned about a downgrade after enron
yesterday restated its earnings for more than four years to
include losses from investment partnerships arranged by senior
executives , people familiar with the situation said .
` ` restating earnings for the past five years is suggestive of
fraud , which in itself is justification for a downgrade , ' ' said
donald coxe , who manages 78 , 000 enron shares as part of the harris
insight equity fund . ` ` i ' d be surprised if they ' re not
downgraded . ' '
the decision by enron chairman and chief executive officer
kenneth lay to reduce earnings by $ 586 million since 1997 is part
of enron ' s efforts to regain confidence among investors stung by
the stock ' s plunge this year and a securities and exchange
commission investigation into how the company accounted for
partnerships it sponsored .
enron fired treasurer ben glisan and kristina mordaunt , a
lawyer for an enron division . the company said it now believes
glisan , mordaunt and two other employees no longer working for
enron bought interests in subsidiaries of a partnership run by
former chief financial officer andrew fastow .
enron ousted fastow last month after revealing an accounting
error for transactions with a group of the partnerships resulted
in a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity in the third
quarter . arthur andersen llp was enron ' s independent auditor .
india
enron wants $ 1 billion for its 65 percent stake in an indian
power plant unit , dabhol power co . potential buyers tata power co .
and bses ltd . , which are at the meeting with lenders in singapore ,
said that ' s too much .
` ` tata and bses are keen to buy the project but much will
depend on the terms enron sets , ' ' said v . k . saxena , chief general
manager at industrial development bank of india , or idbi , the
country ' s second - biggest lender . ` ` i ' m positive ' ' on the outcome
of the talks .
enron on may 19 gave six months ' notice to cancel sales to
the maharashtra state electricity board , the only customer of
dabhol power . dabhol ' s owed $ 64 million for bills that are 10
months overdue . the contract to sell the plant ' s electricity will
be canceled on nov . 19 .
idbi and the state bank of india are among the local lenders
meeting enron in singapore . indian banks , which have loaned $ 1 . 4
billion to dabhol , have the most at stake if a buyer for enron ' s
stake isn ' t found . idbi alone has lent more than $ 400 million .
the $ 600 million lent by abn amro , bank of america corp . ,
citigroup inc . and other overseas banks are covered by government
guarantees , while indian bank ' s loans are not .
still , not all investors in the local banks are worried by
the prospect of loans turning bad if talks with enron and tata and
bses fail .
` ` this deal is too complex , too big to fail , ' ' said rajat
jain , who oversees 15 billion rupees at idbi - principal asset
management co . , a unit of the country ' s second - biggest lender .
` ` there ' s a lot of money at stake here . all parties , including
lenders , will have to take a hit but the deal will go through . ' '
jain ' s stock funds had 1 . 23 million shares of icici ltd . at
end of september after selling 25 , 813 shares . icici is india ' s
biggest lender and one of dabhol ' s key creditors .
the meeting started yesterday and bankers that attended the
meeting said the talks will end today , saxena said .

singapore ( ap ) - talks in singapore aimed at salvaging the troubled dlrs 2 . 9 billion indian dabhol power project are focusing on two potential buyers for u . s . - based enron corp . ' s controlling stake in the project , a major indian creditor said friday .
the dabhol power co . is 65 percent by houston - based enron .
two of india ' s largest private power companies - tata power co . and bses ltd . - are the only contenders vying to buy enron ' s stake in dabhol , v . k . saxena , chief general manager of the industrial development bank of india , told dow jones newswires friday .
the bank , a major creditor to dabhol power co . , said a two - day meeting in singapore between the indian lenders ' consortium and dabhol officials was progressing well .
"" i remain positive about the outcome of the talks , "" saxena said .
no further details about the content of the closed - door talks were available . dabhol officials declined to comment .
indian lenders , including the industrial finance corp . of india . , had asked the court to order work on the project to resume so that the lenders can recover their money .
in may , enron stopped construction of the 90 percent completed project - india ' s biggest ever foreign investment .
enron also halted supply of electricity on the portion already finished because the maharashtra state electricity board said it could no longer afford the fees it agreed to pay when the contract was signed seven years ago .
indian lenders have provided about 61 billion rupees ( dlrs 1 . 3 billion ) to the power project , while enron and its partners , general electric and bechtel corp . , say they have invested dlrs 1 billion .
"" the domestic lenders have tried to facilitate a meeting between prospective buyers and the seller as we have a common interest in saving this power project from going bust , "" saxena said .

los angeles - ( dow jones ) - it ' s not clear yet how formidable an energy company would emerge if dynegy , inc . ( dyn ) were to step out of embattled enron corp . ' s ( ene ) shadow and acquire it .
energy companies and analysts are united in one sentiment , though : a merger may be the only way to keep enron from going under and possible harming u . s . energy markets overall .
enron and dynegy are both dominant natural gas and electricity marketers in the u . s . , and meshing enron ' s trading expertise with dynegy ' s power plants would seem the recipe for success .
but there are too many unknowns at this point to speculate in much detail on the topic , analysts and energy companies said .

enron earnings drop
ali velshi , fred katayama
11 / 08 / 2001
cnnfn : business unusual
( c ) copyright federal document clearing house . all rights reserved .
ali velshi , cnnfn anchor , business unusual : the energy trading giant enron ( url : http : / / . www . enron . com / ) is restating its earnings downward . this announcement comes less than a month after it said regulators were looking into its off balance sheet deals . those are deals that push the company to reduce shareholders ` equity by more than $ 1 billion . fred katayama has this report .
( begin videotape )
fred katayama , cnnfn correspondent ( voice - over ) : enron delivered another bombshell on a day when wall street was anticipating a merger announcement . the tarnished trader of energy drastically restated its earnings to include losses from partnerships now under investigation . enron is reducing its net income since 1997 by nearly $ 600 million . the company said it is consolidating the results of a few partnerships that had been left off the balance sheet . enron would pump assets into a partnership , then have the partnership borrow money so that the debt was kept off of its books . consolidating the partnerships also boosted enron ` s debt by more than $ 2 . 5 billion .
ron barone , ubs warburg : if they lose their investment grade on their debt , the possibility exists that they may have to pay off over $ 3 billion either in cash or enron stock .
katayama : enron fired its treasurer and a lawyer who it believes had invested in a partnership run by its former chief financial officer , andrew fastow ( ph ) . the sec is investigating the two partnerships set up by fastow . chairman kenneth lay said in a statement , we believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the sec about these matters .
andre meade , commerzbank securities : the disclosure probably raises as many questions as it answers and what enron , what enron ` s trying to do is or what enron has done .
katayama : enron stock slumped further and dynegy ( url : http : / / www . dynegy . com / ) rose on the news . investors were disappointed because they had hoped dynegy would announce it would buy its beleaguered rival .
( end videotape )
katayama : now some analysts say uncertainty hangs over any deal . dynegy will have to recalculate enron ` s worth based on the restated numbers and as for those restated numbers , it may not be the last of those restatements . that ` s because , in this current case , today ` s disclosure concerned only three entities . enron has done deals with more than 30 partnerships . ali .
velshi : fred , tell me about these partnerships . is this common ?
katayama : other companies have these limited partnerships but the difference is the scope of enron . say it deals with more than 30 of them . plus they ` re extremely complex . even wall street analysts said they couldn ` t figure them out . and you don ` t have a chief financial officer of your company running some of these partnerships that are doing business with your company .
velshi : let ` s talk about enron stock . this used to be a darling stock . it ` s trading $ 1 . 40 off its 52 - week low . in fact at this moment , it ` s one tenth of its 52 - week high .
katayama : right . you know , that stock used to be as you say , a darling of wall street . it traded almost like a tech stock . because here was this pipeline company in texas that all of a sudden was into fiber optics , was into broadband and it traded like a tech stock . it also fell like a tech stock . that stock is down 73 percent over the last month , down 89 percent year to date and was down 10 days in a row in october .
velshi : let ` s talk about dynegy . last night on this show the news came out that dynegy was going to pump some money into enron and that over the course of the next 12 hours , that became discussions on a merger and a partnership . i don ` t want to use the word partnership . tell me what ` s likely to happen there .
katayama : well , the thing is , wall street was really anticipating , based on yesterday ` s build up , that we get an announcement today saying the two companies would merge , that dynegy would buy enron , possibly for 7 , 8 billion . but a lot of analysts say one , dynegy wants to recalculate those numbers based on those restatements and two , even if there is a deal , enron will get zero premium or very little because there ` s very little negotiating room . it ` s got $ 13 billion of debt and all these troubles behind it .
velshi : any indication of when we ` re going to hear about this restating and what we ` re going to see happen out of it ? that ` s always bad news when you ` ve got to restate for that far back .
katayama : and it always hangs on a stock . you remember it happened to cendant ( url : http : / / www . cendant . com / ) . you remember it happened to sunbeam ( url : http : / / www . sunbeam . com / ) . the thing is , it ` s probably going to unravel over weeks and it ` s not going to be any time soon and that may also mean any deal may be dragged down . that ` s a problem , because what are enron ` s assets ? traders , human capital . and in times of uncertainty , human capital goes to other companies and texas has a lot of energy trading companies .
velshi : fred , thanks very much for being with us .

55,55,Ham,"they are apparently not going to roll over .
as you are well aware , we filed an arbitration against epme under the swap agreement and el paso corp . under the guaranty . our hope was that once the el paso legal department got involved this would come to an amicable resolution . not so fast . while epme recognizes that it is contractually obligated to arbitrate under the swap agreement , el paso corp . is claiming that it is not subject to arbitration and has filed a lawsuit asking a court to declare that el paso corp . is not subject to arbitration .
we had a call with el paso ' s lawyers early this morning to discuss where we are and where we are going . we told el paso ' s lawyers that we will agree to drop el paso corp . from the arbitration if they agree to drop their lawsuit . ( i have talked to duran and deffner about this and they have made it clear that our overriding objective is to monetize the swap agreement . to do so , we need an arbitration panel ' s ruling on the confidentiality provision in the swap agreement . the guaranty issue is , in their view , of secondary concern at this time ) . during the call , epme asked for 10 days to name their party arbitrator . we agreed . by the way , we have already appointed our party arbitrator . el paso ' s lawyers are going to check with their client today to confirm that the lawsuit will be dropped .
on the arbitration front , once epme names its party arbitrator , the two party arbitrators will get together and select a neutral arbitrator . we should expect that process to take about 30 days . then the entire arbitration panel will get together and set an arbitration schedule .
i will keep you updated .

test how you doing have you spoken to clay since he and i went to ya'lls ranch we had a truly wild time early saturday morning we ran into a little family of javelinas and had a stare down from about escapenumber feet with a young male after his sows and piglets crossed directly in front of us w out notice we were all cammo'ed up and i imagine we may have looked like that predator creature to him as he was crossing the path he must have caught our scent as he first turned his head in our direction and then fully squared off directly in front of me in the middle of the small game trail we were on he was looking right at me but i could tell he couldn't really see me neither clay nor i moved even a fraction clay was close behind me and to my right looking over my shoulder so we may have looked like a two headed predator but more importantly clay was blocking my escape path there was a very large and thick prickly pear cactus outgrowth to my left at first it was just an incredibly cool nature experience i expected him to catch our scent at any moment and hightail it but he didn't after staring at us for maybe a full escapenumber mins his wet black snout occasionally flaring giving me an exceptional view of the blotched pink insides of his nostrils he took a very pronounced step toward us right front leg bent in mid air he then very deliberately stomped it down hard on the ground making a small thumping noise he then followed this with the left front leg stomp between each step he'd inhale with a deep audible snort trying to figure us out step stomp pause snort step stomp pause snort step stomp pause snort step stomp pause snort now not knowing much about javelinas and figuring this little dude didn't weigh more than escapenumber lbs i wasn't exactly scared but i was definitely on an adrenaline high my heart racing i was slightly concerned that if on the off chance that he did charge which i honestly didn't think he'd would i was going to be in some trouble i doubted i could have gotten a shot off and clay as i said was blocking my escape path i lost my nerve after what seemed like escapenumber escapenumber mins of this he was now within escapenumber feet of me i turned my head very slowly to the side never taking my eyes off the little fire plug to ask clay how close should we let him get the slight motion of my head turning was all he needed he apparently now had a lock on his target me and he charged it all happened so damn fast but there was that surreal quality of slow motion over the next escapenumber seconds he opened his mouth really wide unusually freakishly wide and i could see two large incisor teeth on his bottom jaw jutting up escapenumber or escapenumber inches these had not been evident to me prior to this simultaneously i sensed clay turning to run fast for whatever reason running was not even an option i considered i swung my shotgun seven to ten inches to my center instantaneously deciding this was going to have to be a hip shot i somehow calmly thumbed the safety off aimed and fired at this oncoming mass of mouth and course black hair now probably no more than three feet directly in front of me i was loaded with two escapenumber gauge slugs the single shot i fired blew a fairly large hole through the top of his head but his forward momentum carried him through my legs at shin level knocking me hard forward and over the javelina splaying me stomach first flat on the ground still clutching my shotgun the fall knocked the wind out of me but i quickly got up on one knee not knowing how true my aim had been and swung my gun back on the downed pig no movement whatsoever it was eerily quiet for just a few seconds and i felt a slight and strange breeze i then heard some crashing noise in the brush near by and one of the sows exploded through the thicket to my left coming right for me holy shit i couldn't believe it still kneeling and still with no breath i swung my shouldered shotgun and shot her in the chest at probably fifteen feet because i was on my knees the blast hit her squarely and lifted her up and to the left of the trail but to my horror immediately behind her and coming fast was a large male we had not previously seen he looked twice the size of the first javelina he was all gray and grizzled and he too had his mouth fully opened his tusks literally gleaming however i was seeing 'his' charge head on at eye level out of ammo and quite frankly nothing was going through my mind other than oh shit oh shit oh shit i then heard clay yell holler demand very loudly don't move and then bammmmm i didn't move my eyes were glued to the boar clay's shot nailed the old male in the left shoulder powering him ten feet to my left from the spot of impact as if he'd been kicked by a giant invisible boot before he came to a sudden stop against a mesquite tree three shots in maybe escapenumber seconds three dead javelinas blood and stink everywhere clay came running over to me yelling something like are you ok are you ok and helped me up the rest of the way i was shaking like a leaf and trying to get my breath back and he started laughing hard i mean really hard after seeing i was ok somehow i had javalena blood on the left palm of my hand after dusting off i notice the inside of my left pant leg was ripped and my left boot was cleanly sheered from the inside of my right ankle through the top of the boot where the calf starts but my skin was not even nicked mannnn i'll never think of those damn javelina the same way again and i don't even want to think what may

was forwarded to me this morning someone's notes from the call listened in on the analyst call this morning here are my notes did not yet have a chance to organize them so they're simply in chronological order the call began with watson bergstrom and whalley reading from prepared statements watson spoke for c escapenumber minutes bergstrom for escapenumber and whalley spoke for perhaps escapenumber seconds dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them specific points ees will be a part of the new company enron assets will be revalued at closing the investment in northern natural takes the form of convertible preferred if the merger does not go through dynegy has the right to acquire northern for 'very little' additional consideration if dyn terminates the merger and ene 'has sufficient liquidity' ene has right to repurchase the convertible preferred debt equity of combined company expected to be escapenumber both companies will remain on ratingswatch negative chevrontexaco will hold escapenumbermm shares out of a total escapenumbermm shares of the post merger entity watson reiterates that going forward the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure with a significant reduction in on and off balance sheet leverage in what was termed a new approach the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings rumors that dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to enron are not true dynegy owed enron escapenumbermm lay says that enron had other options 'particularly financial' all of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big' but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure lay says we have nothing else to hide but internal investigation still under way lay had the spes been capitalized with perhaps escapenumbermm more of risk capital there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off balance sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the spes dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at enron and thus dyn ene cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there doty dynegy cfo says that late last week ene had 'close to a billion' in cash osprey will be unwound late next summer marlin will be unwound after closing many of the off balance sheet structures including the credit linked notes are expected to be unwound redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing with regard to ene asset dispositions these will be accelerated to the extent possible however doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall' and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash ene will renew its escapenumber day facility believe this is the escapenumberbn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago within the next escapenumber escapenumber weeks bbb flat most likely rating for combined entity according to initial comments from ratings agencies mcmahon says 'no comment' to wsj article indicating that ene's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ene in the next few weeks consolidation of trading activity mid and back office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing such that only the front office trading books will need to be combined at closing ees nng and tw have no real overlap with existing dyn activity so there won't be much integration work required there the big integration effort will be ena watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non core assets doty adds that 'frankly' dyn assigned zero economic value to non core businesses in their valuation model uh oh they bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non core assets businesses and left it at that watson mentions that dyn would not have gotten involved with enron had they not been approached by 'enron's top three executives' who said that they thought a combination with dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies says that their approach evidenced a willingness to work with dyn to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger watson doty said that they're not escapenumber sure that no surprises remain in enron's books but that the risk reward offered by the combination was compelling the deal does have material adverse change outs for dynegy covering any mac regarding enron's assets or businesses dynegy's lawyers indicated that the mac language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case so dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the enron's total legal liability from any source or cause of action tops escapenumber escapenumberbn prior to closing mcmahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements ene international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list the merger structure calls for a new entity to take over enron enron is planning to hold an enron specific conference call in the next few days tentatively scheduled for wednesday initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities mcmahon acknowledges that enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year end had the merger not materialized dynegy's earnings guidance places enron related earnings accretion at escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber which represents a 'escapenumber haircut' to enron internal estimates doty says that this is all operating earnings figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies doty says that both enron and dynegy's books as far as he understands are relatively short term in weight and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash chevrontexaco's investment in dynegy was calculated at a escapenumber discount to public prices on the date of negotiation not disclosed given the runup in dynegy stock last week chevrontexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices chevrontexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better' no further clarification given whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the enron traders and marketers they're used to being part of a winning team and the combined entity will definitely be a winner they have talked with most of the enron business leaders and they are 'very excited' by the combination they will be working with the enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions he says that 'to the extent necessary yes ' watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of dyn and ene there will be more of an asset backed trading focus but by the same token the new dynegy will be involved in much more financial market making trading than the dynegy of today watson says that if there were to be any change in culture he's a strong team player he does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well give me a call if

i think very highly of steve and think about coaching him a bit to expand his
horizons . i see him as a very valuable asset of enron and a great leader
in not too distant future . he needs exposure to more diverse business
problems and areas of research . i think it will be in the best interest of

137,137,Spam,"the oi | and gas advisory
now that oi | and gas has entered a | ong - term bull market ,
our speciaity in pinpointing the hottest companies of the few remaining
undervaiued energy piays has produced soaring returns .
emerson oi | and gas ( eogi ) is an energy deveioper in the us "" oi | belt ""
and in canada ' s most highly coveted reservoirs with generating
potentia | of millions per week .
breaking news ! ! !
vancouver , apri | 22 - emerson oi | and gas , inc . , announced a decision to
explore the development of driiling programs in wyoming ( usa ) , as we | |
as alberta ( canada ) , where several more very intriguing prospects , that
include existing production , are deveioping rapidiy . emerson will
announce further details as lease opportunities and contract negotiations
come to fruition .
one of the most effective ways to acquire financing for dri | | ing
programs invoives existing production of oi | and or gas opportunities , as
wel | as targeted areas with surrounding production . emerson is very
optimistic that with its current deal flow it will be abie to build a solid
foundation to grow .
david harker , emerson president stated , "" we at emerson are aggressively
pursuing al | possibie opportunities for growth and success . we believe that in many
situations we wil | have the opportunity to inciude existing production in a driliing program , which
will always encourage the participation of financial partners . ""
symbol - eogi
price - . 09
the value of eogi ' s shares wil | skyrocket :
1 . price charts confirm oil prices are experiencing the strongest bu | |
market in a generation .
2 . natura | gas prices have tripied in the last two years .
3 . with multiple projects in high - gear and the expanding production on
reserves worth multi - millions , eogi is seliing for | ess than 1 / 4 the
vaiue of its assets .
4 . emerson oil and gas specializes in using new technology to turn
unproductive oil and gas deposits into profitabie enterprises .
aiready shares in the oi | and gas sector are rising faster than the
overal | market . in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry
sectors for the past year are energy reiated . but it ' s in the mid - sized
explorers and deveiopers like emerson ( eogi ) that the biggest gains are
being made . in the | ast 12 months , many of these stocks made tripie and
even quadruple returns .
our subscribers need to pay particulariy close attention to undervalued
eogi shares , because it won ' t be a bargain for long . this small company
with a comparabiy smail market value , is sitting on a bonanza of oil
and gas reserves - an unrecognized bonus for investors especiaily with
the daiiy jump in energy prices .
but al | that wiil change in a few short weeks , as these reserves move
into production , bringing an explosion of cash that is expected to
capture the attention of the market , and have an equaliy expiosive
effect on the share price .
what wiil the cash fiow from these projects do for the price of emerson
oil and gas ' shares ? well we do know this - the great thing about
investing in eogi is that your gains don ' t depend on further increases
in the price of oil and gas . even if energy prices stay flat , or
deciine
siightly , you will stiil make a very heaithy return . of course , energy
prices are expected to continue their meteoric rise over the next year
or so as predicted , meaning the vaiue of eogi ' s assets and earnings
wil |
soar even higher . in that case , the reward for investors wiil be
staggering .
overal | , we consider eogi to be one of the last outstanding energy
plays in the oil and gas sector . once this discovery has been reaiized ,
eogi shares wiil surge sharply on heavy investor attention . we have
identified this discovery for immediate accumuiation . eogi ' s oil and
gas reserves are well established and are going into massive
production .
early investors wiil secure optimum gains , and any additiona | news in
this
area wiil reaily turn up the heat , causing us to revise our targets
upward in next week ' s builetin .

154,154,Ham,state loses escapenumber million in power plays ploys it sold some energy for loss gave some away sf gate news october escapenumber escapenumber vote for public power no guarantee it will happen two propositions on s f ballot sf gate news october escapenumber escapenumber power plant assessment to be taken over by state dow jones interactive october escapenumber escapenumber ontario electricity market inches closer to deregulation dow jones interactive october escapenumber escapenumber ferc to give states a role in rto formation dow jones interactive october escapenumber escapenumber state loses escapenumber million in power plays ploys it sold some energy for loss gave some away sacramento california sold electricity on a day it endured rolling blackouts and gave it away for free on another day earlier this year according to documents that detail at least escapenumber million in power trading losses the state department of water resources which has stepped in as the power buyer for troubled utilities said yesterday that it sold escapenumber escapenumber megawatt hours of electricity during the three month period ending in june that represents about escapenumber percent of the total traded during that period included were some sales for next to nothing or nothing at all on may escapenumber the state sold escapenumber megawatt hours of power for escapenumber cents apiece to the los angeles department of water and power the state paid an average of escapenumber a megawatt hour during may two days later the state gave away escapenumber megawatt hours of power to a british columbia utility we may not have had a buyer said oscar hidalgo spokesman for the department of water resources it's not a storable product giving the electricity away may have actually saved the state money he said because power grid rules can require buyers to pay a generator not to produce power if the system doesn't need it other department of water resources records show that the state also sold power march escapenumber when escapenumber escapenumber million customers statewide lost electricity in rolling blackouts for about escapenumber minutes officials said the fact that the state had to sell power that day was a reflection of how chaotic and fast changing the electricity supply and demand situation was during the height of the energy crisis state officials say it is normal for any energy buying operation to have a surplus of electricity occasionally turning into a seller from time to time they say has helped the state to drive down prices and steadily lower monthly power buying costs but critics say the size of the losses is proof that the state locked in too much power at above market rates in its early forays into the electricity buying business i suspect that these losses are continuing and that they are continuing because the department of water resources bought more power than we needed during the cool summer said assemblyman john campbell r irvine vote for public power no guarantee it will happen two propositions on s f ballot if san francisco voters decide nov escapenumber that a public agency is a better bet to provide cheaper more reliable power than pg e it will be some time before the switch is flipped propositions f and i which only set up the first steps toward public control also face possible legal challenges from pacific gas and electric co and other large utilities that have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars campaigning against the measures there is also uncertainty about the costs neither measure has a price tag attached for more than two decades in san francisco pg e has lobbied city hall vigorously and used legal maneuvers to keep public power off the ballot but the company was thwarted in the past year by a voter backed initiative drive and a board of supervisors that advocates local control over the electrical system the move gained steam with the state energy crisis if san francisco voters take the initial steps toward public power on nov escapenumber they will join more than escapenumber escapenumber public jurisdictions including sacramento los angeles and seattle that provide electric power to about escapenumber million customers accounting for escapenumber percent of the demand in the united states proposition i would establish a municipal utility district or mud in san francisco and neighboring brisbane that would be governed by an elected five member board of directors measure backers included brisbane to meet a state requirement that more than one jurisdiction in a municipal utility district the directors after conducting a feasibility study could decide to provide electricity directly to residents and businesses they then could use eminent domain to take over the electrical generation and distribution lines from pg e and the san francisco owned hetch hetchy water and power agency the other measure proposition f would set up a water and power agency for san francisco only the agency would be governed by an elected seven member board of directors and would replace the mayor appointed public utilities commission the puc currently provides electricity to municipal operations and water and sewer service to homes and businesses like the mud called for in proposition i the agency would have to conduct a feasibility study to review the costs and benefits of public power then with the consent of the board of supervisors the agency could take over pg e's electricity system no such board consent would be needed under proposition i the agency also would have the ability to issue revenue bonds under escapenumber million without approval by supervisors or voters anything over that amount would be subject to a referendum the prop f plan is also designed to promote conservation efforts and renewable energy props f and i both rely on elected directors who ultimately will decide whether to create a public power system the board would also set the rates and have control over everything from the terms for buying electricity to whether to use more renewable energy sources such as wind hydroelectric and solar power if both measures pass prop i will take priority supervisors placed prop f on the ballot as a backup one they believe could better withstand the expected legal challenges from pg e the utility waged a escapenumber year battle to beat back public power in sacramento and eventually lost opponents of the s f public power effort with pg e at the lead already have spent more than escapenumber escapenumber on the campaigns against the measures with more money expected in the coming weeks at t and pacific bell also have been big contributors fearful that the mud directors will use state laws to take over the phone and communications utilities in san francisco as well public power critics say there are too many unknowns in the proposals chief among them the cost city controller ed harrington noted that a disputed escapenumber study commissioned by the san francisco puc estimated the value of pg e's distribution system at escapenumber million other estimates have ranged from escapenumber million to escapenumber billion a lot of people are not happy with pg e but neither of these measures can guarantee that they're going to solve the state's power problem or provide us better more reliable or cheaper service said jim mathias vice president of public affairs for the san francisco chamber of commerce the unknown could be worse proponents however say a public power system answers to voters and ratepayers not corporate shareholders historically such public power systems have had lower rates the only unknowns are ephemeral because we've seen through the sacramento mud the alameda mud and the los angeles public power authority that rates are lower and service is better said board of supervisors president tom ammiano a public power advocate the mud measures san francisco voters face two public power measures on the nov escapenumber ballot proposition f placed on the ballot by the board of supervisors the measure would abolish san francisco's public utilities commission and replace it with a municipal water and power agency the agency would be governed by an elected seven member board of directors authorize the agency to take over the existing hetch hetchy water and power system which is now operated by the city puc order a feasibility study to determine the costs and benefits of providing public power to san francisco consumers operate with the goal of ending pacific gas and electric co 's control of electricity distribution in san francisco and create a public power system that would sell electricity directly to residents and businesses it also would continue to provide water and sewer service as the local puc has allow the agency to issue revenue bonds without approval by the board of supervisors or voters any bond issue of more than escapenumber million would be subject to referendum require the new agency to maintain some ties to city hall for example the board of supervisors would have to approve the use of eminent domain to take over pg e's distribution lines and generation facilities proposition i placed on the ballot by initiative the measure would establish a municipal utility district for both san francisco and brisbane the district would be run by an elected five member board of directors candidates for the director posts also are on the nov escapenumber ballot give directors the authority to determine whether to take over pg e's electrical and distribution system in san francisco as well as the hetch hetchy system in order to provide publicly owned power directly to ratepayers requires a feasibility study of such an action subsequent voter approval of specific projects probably would be required allow the district to investigate whether it should provide water transportation garbage collection telephone communications and sewer services as allowed by state law governing municipal utility districts give the mud power as a state agency independent of the brisbane and san francisco local governments allow the directors to undertake eminent domain proceedings and provide authority to issue revenue bonds power plant assessment to be taken over by state over protests from cities that fear a sharp loss in revenue the state board of equalization voted yesterday to take over the appraisal of power generators but postponed doing so for one year the delay until jan escapenumber escapenumber is designed to give the legislature time to fix what opponents call a fatal flaw in the plan under the old rule property tax revenue from power plants was assessed by the counties with the property tax going to the redevelopment agencies in the city the plant is situated the board changed that so that the state now assesses the plant spreading the money out across the county that means big losses for a city such as pittsburg which has been fighting the plan the city which has two new power plants expected escapenumber million in property tax revenue with the changes that will be reduced to just escapenumber escapenumber said john knox an attorney hired by the city pittsburg vice mayor frank aiello said the property tax revenue was one reason the city agreed to have the plants built in its community you'll see more and more power plants not being sited he told the board there will be an even bigger energy crisis he said the move will have a devastating effect on the city's redevelopment agency supporters of the plan believe power generators have gotten off too easy under local assessors that is because counties are barred from increasing assessments more than escapenumber percent a year under proposition escapenumber ontario electricity market inches closer to deregulation calgary dow jones the province of ontario opened another door to electric deregulation wednesday issuing tough new emission standards for industry and lifting a two year moratorium on the sale of provincially owned coal fired generation plants loosening ontario power generation's hold on the bulk of the province's power plants is critical to launching an electricity market slated to open by may escapenumber after three delays in as many years putting additional generation assets in the hands of competition to opg is one of the primary objectives said john dalton director at navigant consulting inc in toronto the utility has five coal fired power plants including the escapenumber escapenumber megawatt naticoke and escapenumber escapenumber mw lambton stations where the government has accepted opg installing selective catalytic reduction units to cut down smog rather than converting to other fuels right now without putting these generation assets under the control of competition essentially we don't have a power market we have a regulatory scheme dalton said sale of the plants had been put on hold until the environment ministry finalized its anti pollution regulations the new rules issued wednesday by environment minister elizabeth witmer will cap emissions by fossil fuel burning generation stations starting jan escapenumber and will be fully implemented by escapenumber under the government's plan for deregulation opg must sell or lease about escapenumber escapenumber mw of non nuclear power within escapenumber months of market opening the utility owns escapenumber escapenumber mw of fossil fuel capacity escapenumber escapenumber mw of nuclear power and escapenumber escapenumber mw of hydroelectric power lifting the moratorium goes a long way toward opg moving quickly to its decontrol program and preparing for an open market opg spokesman john earl said this latest move has the industry optimistic that the provincial government could open electricity markets by early rather than late spring we're working on being ready for march escapenumber an industry source told dow jones newswires there will be lots of supply on the market because the economy is slower than anticipated and demand is down that's what the government wants lots of supply and some choice for consumers a separate regulation finalized wednesday ordered opg's aging lakeview plant to stop burning coal by escapenumber the edict gave new life to the four units that faced being completely shut down but still doesn't make them that attractive to buyers dalton said lakeview operates about escapenumber of the year at a lower fuel cost than cleaner burning natural gas plants converting to an alternative fuel will increase cost on units that are last on the fossil fuel plant list to be dispatched meaning they will run even fewer hours and at lower rates ferc to give states a role in rto formation washington oct escapenumber reuters u s federal energy regulators on wednesday pledged to create a new body to cooperate with state officials on the planning of regional transmission grid combinations after complaints that they were left out of the process the federal energy regulatory commission which oversees the country's power grid operators has ordered utilities in the southeast northeast midwest and west to combine their assets into a handful of regional transmission organizations rtos by the end of the year the agency has pushed hard to create the rtos to avoid a repeat of the power crisis in california last winter in which the antiquated u s grid prevented more power from flowing into the state ferc commissioners acknowledged on wednesday that some changes were needed to address criticism from state utilities regulators that they were left out of the rto rule making process states get seat at the table ferc commissioner nora mead brownell a former pennsylvania regulatory official proposed creating a regional council that would share authority between ferc and states on setting rto policies citing states' confusion about ferc's direction and inconsistent internal agency communication brownell in a memo to commissioners said the council can provide the necessary flexibility that we will likely need moving forward to rto formation the request was made by david svanda commissioner of the michigan public service commission on behalf of six other midwest states at ferc's workshop on rtos last week the move is a ceding of jurisdiction to state regulators for us to co govern the process with them ferc chairman pat wood told reporters after the meeting wood previously headed texas' state utility regulatory agency of state commissions wood said they need to be invited with a nice seat at the table not just standing at the door taking tickets cost benefit analysis promised ferc also promised to prepare a formal cost benefit analysis of rtos for states and consumers after some states raised concerns that the costs did not justify the benefits the agency did not say when the study would be completed on tuesday the new york independent system operator iso released its own cost benefit study which asserted the creation of a large northeastern rto could boost consumer power bills by some escapenumber million a year the non profit new york iso would also be put out of business by a regional for profit rto however a separate study issued last month by energy firm mirant corp a supporter of rtos concluded that a northeastern rto would save consumers escapenumber million annually at the meeting ferc commissioners heard staff presentations on rto development progress in the southeast northeast and midwest but few new details emerged on the ultimate direction ferc will take in guiding utilities wood said that more specifics would be available at the next meeting on nov escapenumber just a month ahead of ferc's dec escapenumber deadline for rto membership under ferc's plan the rtos would be for profit groups in the u s northeast midwest southeast and west each region would combine public utility transmission facilities to provide open access more reliable power and lower rates for consumers ,

221,221,Ham,i am certainly for this idea i feel that taking speakup out of the kernel and putting it in userspace would be stripping it of its most valuable feature speaking from bootup to shutdown if the code can be updated and fixed properly then it should be included in the mainline kernel does anyone know what linus's opinion of this is original message from igor gueths to sent wednesday june escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber pm subject speakup in mainline was gentoo dropping speakup begin pgp signed message hash shaescapenumber hi all i have been observing this thread for quite some time and one question keeps jumping out at me every time i see another message regarding moving speakup into userspace why is it that instead of discussing ways to get speakup into mainline we are contemplating rewriting speakup as a userspace hybrid program thereby introducing entirely new bugs problems imo the only thing we are doing by contemplating this possible rewrite is shifting the focus away from the underlying problem that afaik has been with us since the linux escapenumber escapenumber days as has probably been outlined here various times in the past having speakup in the mainline kernel tree has several advantages first breakage building problems would be pretty nonexistent since the rest of the kernel community would at least have to acknowledge the existence of speakup in the tree also kirk's job of constantly rewriting new code fixing existing code as a result of some change in a later kernel version would probably become significantly easier since the console etc code that speakup relies on for its underlying operation would have to be written and or modified with speakup in mind not the other way around what i am trying to say by all this is that the advantages to having speakup in the mainline kernel tree are numerous however the problem is and has been getting to that point afaik there is still progress attempting to be made on this front such as a git repository being made for speakup and the driver patches however as i understand it speakup's code needs quite a bit of cleaning up befor it can be considered for inclusion into mainline unfortunately i am not nearly familiar enough with the kernel code to be able to aid in this task however i believe that if we all work together to achieve this goal that it in fact can be done with regard to gentoo dropping speakup as of later releases while it is a setback as far as getting speakup into as many distros as possible goes i don't see why it can't be re included in gentoo at some later date once build and possibly other issues are resolved with speakup patched into linux escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber in summary imo userspace speakup is not the only answer nor is it the correct one speakup should remain in the kernel so as to provide the best screen reading experience possible however in order to achieve this end we first need to get speakup into mainline this may take quite a bit of time and hacking however in time i think it can be done feel free to add any comments as necessary i am curious as to what everyone has to say on this igor begin pgp signature version gnupg vescapenumber escapenumber escapenumber gnu linux escapelong escapelong escapelong escapelong escapelong escapelong escapelong jescapenumber cgc escapelong escapelong escapelong escapelong escapelong escapelong escapelong escapelong escapelong escapelong g escapelong xfez ujx escapelong zcuq escapelong a escapelong escapelong xdk escapelong cnuk qltwwdhzlwge escapelong escapelong hhvu end pgp signature this message has been scanned for viruses and dangerous content by mailscanner and is believed to be clean speakup mailing list speakup braille uwo ca http speech braille uwo ca mailman listinfo speakup nodescapenumber escapenumber escapenumber information this message was checked by nodescapenumber antivirus system http www eset com speakup mailing list speakup braille uwo ca http speech braille uwo ca mailman listinfo speakup,

259,259,Ham,here is the revised bullet sheet along with the draft agreement .,
260,260,Ham,"vince ,
per the dialogue below , there seems to be some agreement between our two
groups that a subscription to the "" institute for international finance "" is
worth receiving , but to do so in one central subscription and split the
cost . is a $ 16 k share ok for your group ? we ' ll do $ 32 k on our end , and then
try and sell some of our share to my european counterpart once he gets better
established with a bigger budget .

robert ,
thanks for itemizing the costs . we have decided to cancel the oxford
analytica , as we receive a consensus forecast for currency and inflation from
another source . regarding iif , it is an important source for us . i will
discuss the costs within the research group and advise you of how we will
proceed .

hi maureen and gwyn -
on the oxford analytica front , i ' m glad you have found the service useful .
our contract with them has expired and we are currently negotiating for more
users to have access . our current contract is for $ 50 k or $ 10 k per user per
year . we can charge $ 10 k back to you .
on the iif front , the invoice for $ 47 k is due at the end of the month . here
i would propose that we pay two thirds ( to cover our costs and the costs of
our competitive analysis colleagues in london ) , leaving $ 15 k for you to cover .
since we took on these services last year , we have expanded our range of
sources and projects and are consequently trying to do more with less . thus i
need to allocate some of our costs from oxan and iif to other projects .
let me know what you think about this proposal . maureen , congratulations on
your secondment to enron metals ( gwyn mentioned it to me ) . fyi , our
colleague jim roth is providing competitive analysis support to joe gold and
john sherriff on that project from london .

i started working in june 22 to test path cut capabilities . i was able to save a cut path .
please make sure that bill williams iii and whomever he designates has access to enpower testp so that i can walk them through the app when it is ready . right now it looks like mark guzman and kate symes will be the voice of west real time .
a real time question :
when enpower is taken down for maintenance , as it sometimes is at night , will this application still function ? if not , we need to find a way for the real time crew to be able to access this information when enpower is being maintained .

but routing errors for lines 19 - 223 in the cob sheet produced a routing error that just states "" error : "" no reason . we need to know why an error is shown ( was run after all routes were deleted ) * needs fix

path confirmation :
speed is very much an issue here , i had mark guzman sit with me while i cut a path and when i confirmed a group of paths . the confirmation of 5 paths as a group took 70 seconds from the time i entered the name and hit the "" ok "" button until the confriming was completed . this is too long , we need this to be 20 - 30 seconds max . currently , this process takes about 10 seconds in lotus .
cutting a path went fast enough until i closed the screen to go back to the confirmation report . this also took over a minute . this is another 10 second process in lotus .
one little housekeeping thing , can we move the delete button away from the confrim button ? perhaps on the other side of the exit button ? this will save us mucho headaches later . or make the dialog box look more like a warning that a record has been selected for deletion ?
real time discussion :
where are we on this ? i heard initial rumblings , but nothing lately .",

319,319,Ham,dear frank many thanks for helping out on this should be pretty straight forward i think because it is not a new product so much as a slightly revised version of an existing product us wti there has also been a development which makes it even simpler at first the product was going to be wti which is usually in usd and barrels in jpy and kiloliters but apparently eol have said kiloliters wont actually work so the only twist is that this product will be in yen and not usd i have therefore amended the documents i sent yesterday so i hope you haven't looked at them yet to take the barrel kl conversion language out and to remove the glitch from the business day definition in the gtcs accordingly this email is exhaustive and you can ignore the one i sent yesterday which was at the bottom of alan's email to me i am attaching a number of documents i the first is an internal memo re two new products enron japan wants to put on eol the enron cp will be ena which is why i need your help before going to mark the memo describes the product generally and how it will work and sets out the background as to why ej is pushing this initiative this is fyi only ii iii these are the ii draft product descriptions and iii gtcs and we need ena legal sign off re same if you are happy with these then i will pass to mark taylor for final approval assuming i still need his approval if you have approved can you confirm this i wonder if you have any questions please let me know both documents have been prepared based on the product descriptions and the gtcs currently used for the usd wti product re the product descriptions in addition to those changes to the us wti product description which were needed to reflect the fact that these products are in yen and not in usd we have used upper case for business days because it is defined in the gtcs and the definition is important because it will not refer to japanese holidays and i have incorporated a new definition the relevant scheduled trading date so that in accordance with what i understand to be standard eol procedure the top half of the product description can be the same for both products despite the fact that the currency exchange will be done escapenumber days after a different date in the case of the two definitions and only the bottom half will need to change i know this is not a great way to include definitions in an agreement but i am just trying to keep my changes consistent with the current wti product description methodology i have made no changes to the current wti gtcs i have assumed that when ny law applies to foreign products we don't usually amend the arbitration clause despite the fact that the products are likely to be purchased by non us counter parties i am less sure however about the events of default clause the language seems pretty short and generic so i suspect that we probably don't put cp jurisdiction specific events in but please confirm i understand you are all under pressure there so wonder when you expect you would be able to revert so that i can let the business people here know apparently gtcs can only be loaded once a week at wed noon hou time so unless you can see your way through to doing this during your tuesday i e today your time provided i hear from you by tuesday next week this would be fine re exchange rate sara shackleton suggested recently that a central bank rate would be better then a bank of tokyo mitsubishi rate but the btm exchange rates are market standard here so we would prefer to use these this may be because btm is listed on

how many times have you seen new issues explode but you couldn ' t get your hands on them ? we are alerting you to a special company with a unique business model that is set to explode in next 1 month - - this is your chance to get in at the very beginning !
this is also a chance to get in early , where usually only institutional investors get in , at the beginning . the average investor rarely gets the opportunity to get new issue shares at the beginning because brokers give them all to hedge funds and clients that do thousands of dollars of commission business with them , thereby leaving the small individual out in the cold !
this is exciting business in an exciting place and time . don ' t be the one to look back and say , i had the chance to invest , but passed .

washington - - if enron corp . goes under , the government is unlikely to throw it a lifeline .
at its peak , enron was a major participant in the country ' s financial and energy markets . but economic and financial policy makers say they aren ' t worried about any broader blow to markets or business activity . despite frequent comparisons to long - term capital management , the hedge fund whose 1998 nose dive panicked global financial markets and triggered an unusual bailout brokered by the federal reserve , there has been so far no public sign of any attempt by the fed , the treasury or energy regulators to take similar action on behalf of enron or its creditors .
officials from a range of economic and regulatory agencies have insisted in recent days that while they have been closely monitoring enron ' s situation , they haven ' t seen any reason to be concerned about possible ripple effects . enron "" is just one piece of a very big market , "" said john mielke , chief of market surveillance at the commodity futures trading commission . mr . mielke said he saw no evidence that enron ' s problems have disrupted trading on the futures exchanges monitored by the cftc .
"" these are deep and pretty big markets that enron is in , "" echoed william gilmer , an economist at the federal reserve bank of dallas .
it is too soon to say exactly what the total damage from enron ' s potential demise will be . one danger is that a blowup in the company ' s complex , largely unregulated portfolio of derivatives could infect financial markets in wide and unpredictable ways , just as ltcm ' s did . another worry : that the collapse of a major middleman in natural - gas and power markets could disrupt supplies .
enron does share some characteristics with ltcm , including widespread activities in complicated financial instruments in numerous markets , with little detailed public explanation of those activities , and little regulatory oversight of those trades .
its public disclosures suggest enron ' s exposures are substantial . a quarterly filing listed $ 18 . 7 billion in assets and an equal amount of liabilities related to "" price risk management activities "" as of sept . 30 . the filing gives no description or breakdown of those amounts and little detail about the derivatives in which enron transacts as a normal part of business . ( a derivative is a financial contract whose value is designed to track the return on stocks , bonds , currencies or other benchmark . ) an enron spokeswoman didn ' t return a call seeking comment .
as enron ' s woes deepened , the government ' s hands were tied in even assessing the situation , in part because the company was part of a coalition of energy companies and banks that lobbied successfully three years ago against cftc efforts to expand regulation of the over - the - counter energy market . enron also worked behind the scene to head off cftc ' s direct regulation of the energy concern ' s enrononline trading operation .
there have been some signs in markets of concerns about enron fallout . interest rates on bonds of utilities and energy companies rose by one - to two - tenths of a percentage point relative to treasurys yesterday . by day ' s end , the dow jones industrial average was off 160 . 74 points , a decline blamed in part on the enron news .
those are relatively small hiccups . the betting is the impact of enron ' s troubles on the financial system will be widespread but thin . enron was a favorite borrower among lenders , and its loans were among the most widely syndicated among the banking system , both at home and abroad . for example , a $ 2 . 25 billion credit facility arranged for enron in may by citigroup inc . and j . p . morgan chase & co . was distributed to 50 different institutions , according to loan pricing corp . , a credit - market research company . those syndication members sold off chunks of that debt to other investors , according to a banker at one of the underwriters .
j . p . morgan chase said in a statement that it has $ 500 million of unsecured exposure to enron entities , including loans , letters of credit and derivatives . it said it also has secured exposures , including $ 400 million in loans secured by enron pipelines . while this exposure is expected to smart , it represents a small fraction of j . p . morgan chase ' s total assets of $ 715 billion . citigroup declined to comment on its exposure to enron , but officials familiar with the matter said the bank ' s exposure is similar to that of j . p . morgan chase .
beyond financial fallout , a concern is the potential impact on energy markets and what that could do to the economy . enron ' s troubles could hamper efforts to end the recession if the company ' s difficulties make it impossible for it to deliver natural gas or electricity to its customers .
natural - gas prices rose sharply yesterday in the minutes after three major credit - rating agencies downgraded enron ' s rating and dynegy inc . said it was calling off its purchase . but the move quickly reversed when traders digested gas - inventory numbers released in the afternoon that showed utilities have stored enough gas to meet demand ahead of the winter heating season .
"" we ' ve seen no interruptions in physical deliveries and no pricing reaction in the futures markets that you could attribute to enron , "" said scott miller , director of market development for the federal energy regulatory commission . "" revenues and transactions are occurring normally as far as we can tell . ""

enron ' s woes may ripple out to others - - - if energy company files for bankruptcy , results are likely to be messy

the sudden , deep financial troubles of enron corp . , the once aggressive , many - tentacled energy conglomerate , could have widespread consequences for scores of companies across the economy .
if enron files for protection under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code , as many investors and financial experts now expect , it is likely to be one of the messiest , most complex bankruptcy cases ever , lawyers say .
that is because of the multifaceted nature of enron ' s once highflying operations , which combined a global energy business with a massive financial - trading operation involving tens of billions of dollars in complex contracts . yesterday , amid the unraveling of a last - ditch merger with dynegy inc . , the company ' s credit was downgraded to "" junk "" status by rating agency standard & poor ' s corp . enron has about 800 trading partners or creditors .
the stock market , signaling that a bankruptcy filing is expected , hammered enron stock , which was halted for a time yesterday , and knocked lower some of its financial backers ' shares . enron shares closed at 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading at 61 cents , down $ 3 . 50 , or 85 % . enron bonds also fell sharply , dropping to 50 cents on the dollar from around 55 cents , reflecting concerns over how much creditors might receive if the company does seek bankruptcy - court protection . j . p . morgan chase and citigroup , which have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in hopes of keeping the enron - dynegy deal alive , also saw their stocks fall . at 4 p . m . in nyse composite trading , j . p . morgan shares were down $ 2 . 30 to $ 37 . 50 , while citigroup shares were down $ 2 . 75 to $ 47 . 80 .
j . p . morgan chase said in a statement it has about $ 500 million of unsecured exposure to enron entities , including loans , letters of credit , and derivatives . it said it also has secured exposures , including $ 400 million in loans secured by enron pipelines .
other companies also disclosed their exposures to enron . exelon corp . , an energy concern in chicago , said its power - trading arm has a direct net exposure to enron of less than $ 10 million , based on its current book of business and existing market prices . exelon said its direct gross exposure based on sales to enron is less than $ 20 million . exelon said this is partly offset by $ 10 million that it owes to enron .
still , while the fallout from a potential bankruptcy filing would be widespread , federal regulators appear little concerned that it could inflict significant damage to the u . s . economy . ( see related article on page al 0 . )
the scale of the enron collapse is huge , experts say . "" there is nothing to compare it to , "" said edward tillinghast , a bankruptcy specialist with coudert brothers in new york . "" the business was so large . there were so many different kinds of operating entities under the enron umbrella . ""
in a way , he added , a filing would represent all the challenges of two of the biggest bankruptcies in recent years - - this past spring ' s chapter 11 filing by pg & e corp . ' s pacific gas & electric utility unit , and the demise of drexel burnham lambert , the wall street securities firm that failed more than a decade ago . a filing by enron , with about $ 13 billion in debt , would rank among the largest bankruptcy filings ever .
bankruptcy lawyers and creditors ' rights specialists , already swamped with a wealth of work from a boom in chapter 11 filings during the last 18 months , said they had been contacted by worried banks and other lenders to enron , seeking to retain them in the event of a chapter 11 filing . enron spokeswoman karen denne said the company is exploring its options and wouldn ' t comment on whether it has retained bankruptcy counsel .
but lawyers said the company was already in discussions about retaining its own counsel . among the likely advisers is new york law firm weil gotshal the idea is to protect all parties from market risk as the value of those contracts can fluctuate from day to day , and to avoid a larger financial meltdown .
that means enron ' s counterparties are free to close out such transactions , rather than file claims in a bankruptcy proceeding reflecting the total notional amount of any trades . in other words , a securities firm that is a counterparty to enron in many financial contracts would tally up how much it owes enron under such contracts and how much enron owes it , offsetting the amounts against each other . but this process is ripe for conflicts , as disputes easily could arise over the value of the contracts .
"" it is an incredibly complex piece of financial engineering , "" andrew rahl , a bankruptcy lawyer at anderson kill & olick in new york , said of the process .
how much collateral those counterparties could seize isn ' t at all clear , either . enron was considered very aggressive in negotiating agreements such as swaps , where a party trades an obligation to pay a floating interest rate for a fixed interest rate on given securities . the speed with which the company ' s finances have deteriorated further reduces the odds that its trading partners will be able to get paid anytime soon . without any security , counterparty claims would go into the probably massive general pool of claims from unsecured creditors .
besides banks and bondholders , dozens of companies , municipalities and utilities that had signed multiyear power contracts with enron may be left in the lurch . over the years , the likes of retailer j . c . penney co . , and shopping - mall company simon property group , of indianapolis , signed on with enron , as it undercut local utilities in newly deregulated markets .
any bankruptcy also is likely to trigger collateral lawsuits , as aggrieved parties look for alternative deep pockets . one possible target , analysts said , could be advisers that helped enron establish off - balance - sheet vehicles and other debt related to troubled investment partnerships , which have triggered massive losses in recent weeks . moreover , enron directors themselves could be vulnerable , too .
yesterday , enron named raymond s . troubh , a new york financial consultant , to its board as chairman of a newly formed special litigation committee to evaluate claims in shareholder and other derivative lawsuits .
at the same time , any filing would give enron some advantages , most notably greater ease in securing financing . this is because once companies file for protection , any new cash infusion from the banks has an overriding claim on any of the company ' s assets , at the expense of previous lenders .
in addition , potential buyers for enron businesses may be more likely to emerge once the company is operating with court protection and the depth of its problems are known .
"" there is a certain comfort level that buyers have when buying a business in a chapter 11 case that doesn ' t exist when a company is struggling outside of bankruptcy , "" said keith shapiro , a bankruptcy lawyer at greenberg traurig in chicago .

credit markets
why credit agencies didn ' t switch off enron - - - s & p cries ` junk , ' but the warning comes too late
by gregory zuckerman and jathon sapsford
staff reporters of the wall street journal

at 10 : 57 a . m . est yesterday , an announcement came out that effectively scuttled dynegy inc . ' s proposed takeover of enron corp . it was issued not by the two companies or their bankers , but by a behind - the - scenes player that was pivotal in the deal from the start .
the news came from standard & poor ' s , which lowered enron ' s credit rating to "" junk "" status , because of concern about the energy trading company ' s financial condition . the move , followed by similar downgrades by moody ' s investors service inc . and fitch inc . several hours later , prompted dynegy to announce that it was walking away from the multibillion dollar deal .
the downgrades highlight the key role that credit - rating agencies - - which are sometimes only bit players - - are having in one of the biggest wall street dramas in years . before they became deal breakers , the ratings agencies had emerged as unlikely deal makers just a few weeks ago , by leaving enron little choice but to seek a merger partner or face a downgrade that would have made it difficult to keep running its business .
throughout the enron saga , the rating agencies found themselves the target of repeated and intense lobbying by enron , dynegy and their bankers at j . p . morgan chase & co . and citigroup inc . all tried - - and ultimately failed - - to come up with assurances that the merger would bolster enron and thus protect bondholders and lenders from suffering losses .
the dramatic downgrades are sure to increase scrutiny over the role of the rating agencies in the enron situation . critics say that , in waiting until enron ' s bonds already had plummeted in value , the ratings agencies failed in their job of anticipating a company ' s financial problems and giving investors an early warning .
it now seems clear that the rating agencies , like most securities analysts , seem to have too easily accepted enron ' s murky financial reporting , which gave the impression that the company ' s balance sheet was stronger than it was . as recently as late october , both moody ' s corp . ' s moody ' s and mcgraw - hill cos . ' s & p had a solid investment - grade rating on enron ' s debt .
but since credit - rating agencies often have access to company information that securities analysts often don ' t have , the rating agencies could take some heat for not anticipating the financial difficulties . bond investors , for instance , say s & p was prematurely upbeat about enron ' s outlook earlier this month , and long ago should have demanded more information from the company . "" if the rating agencies were privy all along to information that , as near as i can tell , was nonpublic regarding these off - balance - sheet liabilities , then their judgment looks even more faulty , "" says carol levenson of gimme credit , a chicago - based analyst .
others wonder whether the ratings executives should have lowered the rating to junk days ago , when enron ' s problems became obvious . while such a move would have crippled the company ' s ability to find a suitor , holding off on the ratings move hurt stock and bond investors left holding the securities .
"" i don ' t think the consequences of a rating action should have anything to do with whether one takes that rating action or not , if one feels it ' s warranted , "" ms . levenson says . "" i don ' t think there was any doubt enron was a junk credit . ""
the ratings agencies counter that enron ' s financial condition , while weakened , became precarious only in the past few days , and given the consequences of a downgrade they needed to be prudent .
indeed , every party to the deal - - until yesterday - - kept working to provide financial infusions to enron to keep the deal alive . enron executives were particularly desperate to hold off a ratings downgrade . once the debt was lowered to junk status from investment grade , a whopping $ 3 . 9 billion of debt immediately became due , jeopardizing enron ' s ability to stay afloat .
worries about such a debt downgrade weeks ago pushed enron into the merger with dynegy , despite reservations from some enron executives about whether the deal was right . enron pledged some of its best assets to secure a $ 500 million investment from j . p . morgan chase and citigroup ' s citibank , and agreed to strict terms demanded by banks to get an emergency $ 1 billion credit line from various banks . in recent days , the two companies worked to restructure their merger and to raise still more liquidity for enron .
by 4 p . m . tuesday , the credit agencies agreed to hold off on a downgrade , convinced the two sides were making progress in restructuring the deal and drumming up new money for enron . in a conference call , ron barone , a managing director at s & p , told enron executives he was willing to wait on a decision , aware of the serious consequences of a downgrade .
"" we ' ll be very patient and diligent "" because of the progress being made , he told them , according to someone familiar with the conversation .
as late as 10 : 30 p . m . tuesday , a new deal still seemed in sight . but at about 2 a . m . yesterday , the talks broke down . instead of being briefed about terms of a new merger agreement , the credit - agency executives became doubtful a resolution would ever be reached .
in a late morning phone call to jeff mcmahon , enron ' s chief financial officer , mr . barone broke the news that the company ' s credit would be downgraded . "" we lost confidence the deal would be consummated in a way that would keep the rating intact , "" mr . barone says in an interview . "" enron ' s credibility and viability continued to diminish . they were aware of our concerns . ""
s & p downgraded enron ' s corporate - credit rating two full grades to single - b - minus , near the lower end of the junk - bond world , from triple - b - minus , the lowest investment - grade level . moody ' s lowered the debt to b 2 from baa 3 .
in a late - afternoon conference call with investors , s & p executives said the rating could still be lowered further , on the heels of the official announcement that the merger with dynegy was off .
responding to criticism that the credit agencies should have downgraded enron ' s debt sooner , mr . barone of s & p notes that the rating agency wasn ' t "" privy to everything . "" still , he adds , until yesterday "" we were confident it was an investment - grade company , and that the merger would give it the security to enable enron to function at an investment - grade level . ""
on the flip side , of course , if enron is forced into bankruptcy , the rating agencies may well catch heat that their impact was too drastic , effectively killing the deal .
treasurys
treasurys ended slightly higher . at 4 p . m . , the benchmark 10 - year treasury note was up 1 / 32 point , or 31 cents per $ 1 , 000 face value , at 100 15 / 32 to yield 4 . 938 % . the 30 - year treasury bond ' s price also was up 1 / 32 point , at 100 9 / 32 to yield 5 . 355 % .
the dow jones industrial average ended with a loss of 160 . 74 points . investors often shift funds to the relative safety of the government securities market at times when stocks are weak . a treasury sale of $ 21 billion of two - year notes drew less demand than expected . the bid - to - cover ratio , a gauge of demand comparing the dollar value of bids received with those awarded , was 1 . 51 , well below the 2 . 53 average of the past 12 auctions .
also somewhat bearish for the bond market was release of the fed ' s beige book report , an assessment of economic conditions around the country in advance of policy meetings . policy makers are to meet again dec . 11 .
although the report cited weakness in the economy , it didn ' t encourage people in the bond market to expect further rate cuts by the fed , analysts said . "" not everybody is in the camp that the fed ' s going to ease again , "" said kevin flanagan , market strategist at morgan stanley .

why credit agencies didn ' t switch off enron - - - energy trading bears the brunt of enron woes

less than a month ago , enron corp . ' s electronic trading system was the largest of its kind in the world , accounting for a quarter of all the natural gas and electricity delivered in the u . s .
yesterday , the system was shut down , a victim of enron ' s failed deal with dynegy inc .
while the rise and sudden fall of enron rippled throughout financial markets yesterday , nowhere was it more immediately evident than in energy trading , an arena utterly transformed by enron in recent years .
since the late 1990 s , enrononline had established itself as the dominant electronic energy marketplace - - and major competitor of the traditional futures exchanges - - as it grew to handle an average of 5 , 400 trades a day , with a value of about $ 2 . 8 billion .
but a flight away from enron began weeks ago , as initial news of the company ' s woes began to spread . because enron itself guaranteed trades on its platform , fears grew that the company might not be able to complete many of the transactions .
the exodus of trading activity from enrononline accelerated throughout the day yesterday , culminating in the system ' s shutdown around midday , when quotes on the system ' s internet trading screens simply went blank .
by 3 : 30 p . m . est , some trading had resumed in natural gas , though spokesman eric thode declined to say whether enron ' s markets would be open today . "" that ' s part of an evaluation that ' s ongoing , "" he said .
on the floor of the new york mercantile exchange , a traditional floor - based futures market , natural - gas trading volume almost doubled yesterday to 116 , 000 contracts . while enron ' s woes were the main driver behind the surge , the market also reacted to important storage data from the american gas association .
natural - gas prices jumped about 25 cents yesterday morning on an initial reaction to the enron news , near $ 3 per million british thermal units , then slipped back as the aga announced that gas storage had grown by 16 billion cubic feet to an all - time high . the nearby december contract fell 29 cents to $ 2 . 315 per million btus .
"" anyone who jumped into the gas market on the enron news is praying right now [ that prices recover ] , "" guy gleichmann , senior energy trader at barkely financial . "" it should only be a short - term factor in the market . ""
he said enron ' s collapse has helped gas prices because it is mainly seen as a threat to the overall gas supply . traders assume enrononline ' s problems won ' t affect actual energy deliveries , because whoever takes over enron ' s assets is expected to honor those commitments .
meantime , anticipating potential fallout from the enron problems , energy firms also have been reducing their financial risk in the energy markets by unwinding complex derivatives bets , either by hedging against them or taking delivery of the physical commodity .
in the future , those firms are likely to favor straightforward cash transactions for energy as a result of the enron meltdown . "" if anything , the enron situation has really simplified this market , "" mr . gleichmann said .
yesterday on the , enron ' s primary electronic rival , traders waited up to five minutes to log in , said jeff sprecher , the online market ' s chief executive .
he said it seemed most traders were just jockeying for position at first , assessing the newfound risk before actually making any trades . within the first 15 minutes after standard & poor ' s initial downgrade of enron , mr . sprecher said , the number of bids and offers on dropped by almost a third , to 2 , 200 .
"" by the end of the day , though , we expect this will probably be a record day for us , "" said mr . sprecher , who estimated the system ' s overall volume is up 45 % this month .
he expects much of that gain to be permanent on ice , although he cautioned that a loss of enrononline from the marketplace would have a downside , since its presence created opportunities to trade spreads between the two platforms .
nymex president j . robert collins warned it is still too early to declare enrononline dead . but he said its difficulties bode well for his exchange ' s internet - based system , dubbed enymex , now in development .
"" because of credit issues involving enron , companies might be more hesitant to trade there , "" he said . "" so we have a better shot with enymex than we did three or four months ago . ""
ronald j . barone , managing director for energy research at ubs warburg , said enrononline ' s value to prospective acquirers will drop quickly in coming days , if the business continues to decline .
"" dynegy really liked enrononline , but look at how much business the platform ' s been losing , "" said mr . barone , who downgraded enron ' s stock yesterday to a hold . "" there ' s also a question of how many more skeletons there are in the closet . ""
in commodity trading yesterday :
grains : futures prices on corn , wheat and soybeans all fell again at the chicago board of trade as what was described as a technical - based selloff accelerated . december - delivery corn futures sank to $ 1 . 9850 a bushel late in the session , which wiped out the old contract low . the contract ended up settling down five cents at $ 1 . 9875 a bushel .
crude oil : crude - oil futures slipped 26 cents to $ 19 . 22 a barrel after weekly inventory data showed a larger - than - expected five - million - barrel build in distillates supplies , which include heating oil . high refinery runs and imports were behind the build , analysts said . the contract might have fallen even more , except for a modest drop reported for crude - oil stocks .

for years , enron corp . chairman kenneth lay has been george w . bush ' s best friend in the board rooms of america ' s top corporations .
since 1993 , mr . lay and enron have donated nearly $ 2 million to mr . bush ' s political career , making them mr . bush ' s biggest backers . when mr . bush was texas governor , mr . lay , a houston resident , helped him win passage of a state education - reform plan that brought mr . bush national acclaim . during that fight , mr . lay got to know aides who became power players in the bush white house .
mr . lay was confident enough of his friendship with mr . bush that he even needled him for needing arthroscopic surgery to repair a jogging injury . "" i want you to know that at least one jogger [ me ] got past 50 without that surgery , "" mr . lay scribbled in a note to then governor in 1997 .
still , as enron faces its greatest crisis , mr . lay ' s influence and personal relationships with the administration have amounted to little . there appears to be no effort by the white house or congress to bail enron out of its difficulties , which are widely seen as self - inflicted . the white house had no comment on mr . lay ' s predicament , a spokeswoman said . indeed , short of an actual bailout to help enron meet its obligations - - such as an aid package approved by congress or organized by government officials from private sources , similar to the rescue of the long term capital management hedge fund - - there is little washington can do at this stage to help the company . nor is there likely to be a bailout , since enron has burned many bridges on capitol hill with its history of strong - arm lobbying tactics , some congressional aides say .
that may reassure a cynical public , says robert mosbacher , commerce secretary in the first bush administration and a longtime friend of the current president as well as mr . lay . "" i don ' t see anybody being let off the hook , "" he said .
mr . mosbacher says he introduced mr . lay to the bush family around 1987 , when he persuaded mr . lay to help raise money for george h . w . bush ' s successful presidential bid in 1988 . mr . lay contributed $ 461 , 000 to the younger mr . bush ' s two successful gubernatorial campaigns . he also made enron ' s fleet of corporate jets available to mr . bush and won his help in lobbying officials in other states considering enron projects .
his influence with then - gov . bush was based on more than money . mr . lay was one of the state ' s leading business executives and deeply involved in texas politics . under mr . bush ' s predecessor , democrat ann richards , mr . lay headed the governor ' s business council , a state advisory board . mr . bush asked him to stay on the job to help develop an educational reform plan and sell it to the texas legislature .
in that capacity , mr . lay became close to several bush aides , including political guru karl rove and communications adviser karen hughes , who have taken positions at the white house . he also got to know another leading texas businessman : dick cheney , then ceo of dallas oil concern halliburton co . , who would become mr . bush ' s pick for vice president .
against this backdrop , mr . lay was widely considered a top candidate for treasury secretary in the younger bush ' s administration . ultimately though , he was disqualified , bush insiders say , as too closely identified with mr . bush , mr . cheney and others who worked in the texas energy business for an administration that wanted to show it wasn ' t in the pocket of big oil companies .
early on , mr . lay had unrivaled access to the administration . when the president ' s advisers debated a new energy policy in the spring , mr . lay was the only energy executive to be invited for a one - on - one session with mr . cheney , who led the effort . mr . lay also worked with mr . rove and others to successfully push for appointments to the federal energy regulatory commission , which oversees much of enron ' s business .
as enron ' s problems multiplied and its fortunes plummeted , however , the white house was silent . during a several - hour long interview in the spring , mr . lay mused that his bush connections could boomerang someday . "" it could hurt , from the standpoint that , at some point , they lean in the other direction to make sure they don ' t face criticism , "" he said .

dynegy and chevrontexaco slide along with plunge in enron stock

new york - - the collapse of enron dominated stock trading yesterday , as a host of the power generators and energy merchants exposed to the firm tumbled .
shares of dynegy , the suitor for enron that pulled out of a deal after debt - rating agencies lowered their ratings on enron ' s bonds , fell 4 . 92 , or 12 % , to 35 . 97 . chevrontexaco , which owns 26 % of dynegy , slid 1 . 07 , or 1 . 2 % , to 84 . 55 .
shares of enron itself were ground down more than 85 % . the loss of $ 3 . 50 brought the closing price of each enron share down to 61 cents . this from a stock that , as recently as august 2000 , commanded more than $ 90 a share .
a host of other energy merchants , such as el paso , which lost 3 . 59 , or 7 . 4 % , to 44 . 91 , williams , which shed 1 . 80 , or 6 . 2 % , to 27 . 05 , and american electric power , which fell 2 . 03 , or 4 . 8 % , to 40 . 44 , all got caught in the backlash against the energy market .
the dow jones utility average finished the session down 8 . 48 points , a drop of 2 . 94 % , to 279 . 95 , which brought it down to a 52 - week low .
shares of two giant financial - services providers also got caught by their exposure to enron , and paid the price . shares of citigroup fell 2 . 75 , or 5 . 4 % , to 47 . 80 , while j . p . morgan chase slid 2 . 30 , or 5 . 8 % , to 37 . 50 .
with those two components in decline , the dow jones industrial average finished the session 160 . 74 points lower , a loss of 1 . 63 % , to 9711 . 86 . the nasdaq composite slid 2 . 48 % , or 48 points , to 1887 . 97 .
the dow industrial average ' s finish at 9711 . 86 represented the lowest close the average has posted in more than two weeks , since ending at 9554 . 37 . traders insisted that the speed and apparent ease with which market averages have managed to lard on gains over the past several weeks has stretched valuations , and left equities vulnerable to events , like the enron sell - off , that a sturdier market might have more handily absorbed .
"" one of the most important overriding factors has been the performance of the market itself , "" arthur hogan , chief market analyst at jefferies , said . "" the market has moved straight up seven weeks in a row , and when it moves up in a straight line like that , it doesn ' t take much in the way of a catalyst to tip it over . ""
whether it was excuse - making or profit - taking , the market did have to absorb some fundamental challenges in the session , including an especially pessimistic assessment of economic conditions from the federal reserve . the central bank released its beige book report on economic conditions , which showed , overall , the economy tilted more toward further slowing than it did toward recovery .
that helped further puncture shares of some of the retailers that got waylaid in tuesday ' s trading by a bearish consumer sentiment reading . shares of gap , stung by a reduction in its investment rating by prudential securities , lost 79 cents , or 5 . 5 % , to 13 . 61 . shares of another apparel retailer , american eagle outfitters , lost 1 . 3 , or 5 . 9 % , to 24 . 40 , while talbots dropped 1 . 25 , or 3 . 6 % , to 33 , and discounter kohl ' s fell 84 cents , or 1 . 2 % , to 67 . 86 .
meanwhile , some of the classic cyclical stocks that have had good runs over the past several weeks as investors bet on an eventual economic recovery gave ground . shares of boeing fell 1 . 33 , or 3 . 7 % , to 34 . 17 , after j . p . morgan reduced its earnings forecasts for 2002 and 2003 . whirlpool lost 1 . 12 , or 1 . 7 % , to 64 . 98 . auto - parts maker eaton declined 1 , or 1 . 4 % , to 69 . 60 . general electric , also subject to some downbeat comments from j . p . morgan , fell 1 . 72 , or 39 . 35 .
continental airlines lost 2 . 40 , or 10 % , to 21 . 70 . the air carrier completed a public offering of 6 . 74 million shares of stock priced at $ 22 . 50 , a discount to tuesday ' s closing price of 24 . 10 .
coca - cola declined 1 . 06 , or 2 . 2 % , to 46 . 75 . j . p . morgan said it expects slower volume growth ahead for the beverage maker ' s bottlers . shares of coca - cola enterprises , coke ' s biggest bottler , eased 40 cents , or 2 . 3 % , to 17 .
magna international rose 1 . 54 , or 2 . 6 % , to 61 . 51 . salomon smith barney started coverage of the canadian auto - components maker with a buy rating .
medtronic gained 1 . 74 , or 4 % , to 45 . 78 . the minneapolis medical - device maker reported fiscal second - quarter results that matched wall street ' s projections , and said it expected to live up to third - quarter forecasts .
foot locker eased 19 cents , or 1 . 2 % , to 15 . 70 , after mixed views from rival brokers . rbc capital markets started coverage of the stock with a strong buy rating , but jefferies reduced its coverage of the stock to accumulate from buy .

dollar declines against yen and euro amid growing doubts on u . s . economy

new york - - growing doubts about the u . s . economy ' s ability to rebound quickly from recession weighed heavily on the dollar , pushing the currency down almost a full yen and helping the euro regain some lost ground .
weakness in u . s . stocks - - due partly to news that dynegy inc . decided to walk away from its deal to buy enron corp . - - also put pressure on the dollar , while enron ' s debt woes added to general skittishness about the ability of u . s . business to bounce back quickly .
"" we know there are companies out there in trouble , "" said lara rhame , economist at brown brothers harriman in new york , who said that while the enron developments weren ' t having a direct impact on foreign - exchange markets , such reports do "" limit the kind of superdollar that we saw back in 1999 . ""
the dollar selloff kicked off in asian trading , when dealers used a standard & poor ' s downgrade of japan ' s sovereign rating as an excuse to buy the yen . the downgrade to double - a from double - a - plus was better than the market ' s expectations of a two - notch downgrade , rendering it good news of sorts .
the selling continued in new york trading , as traders continued to price in the possibility that they may have been far too optimistic about the dollar .
the two - pronged catalyst for this change of heart was the weak november consumer confidence index released tuesday , and subsequent gloomy comments from federal reserve governor laurence meyer pointing to more downside risks to the economy . the release of the federal reserve ' s beige book report yesterday served only to flame this pessimism .
the fed said that further slowing outweighed signs of recovery for the u . s . economy this autumn , noting that economic activity generally remained soft in october and the first half of november .
"" people wanted greater signs of recovery than they got from the fed , "" said alan ruskin , research director at the 4 cast financial consultancy in new york .
the beige book , a summary of economic activity prepared for use at the central bank ' s next federal open market committee meeting dec . 11 , is widely viewed as an indicator of future monetary policy decisions and the report helped to solidify expectations of a rate cut of at least a quarter percentage point .
late yesterday in new york , the euro was at 88 . 84 u . s . cents , its high for the session and up from 88 . 34 cents late tuesday in new york . the dollar was at 123 . 11 yen - - around its intraday low - - and almost a full yen down from 123 . 96 yen late tuesday in new york . the dollar was also at 1 . 6460 swiss francs , down from 1 . 6484 francs in london and 1 . 6560 francs tuesday . sterling was at $ 1 . 4261 , up from $ 1 . 4185 earlier in london and $ 1 . 4153 late tuesday .
elsewhere , the canadian dollar climbed to its highest levels in almost a month , confounding the view that bad news for the u . s . is bad news for canada .
the canadian currency has tended to suffer from an association with the u . s . , given that 85 % of canada ' s exports head south of the border . however , a 0 . 50 - percentage - point rate cut by the bank of canada on tuesday was quickly followed by the gloomy consumer confidence report in the u . s . , which undercut faith in the dollar and appeared to give the canadian unit just the opportunity it was seeking .
late in the new york day , the u . s . dollar was at c $ 1 . 5842 , down from c $ 1 . 5939 late tuesday .

houston - - enron corp . , the subject of four lawsuits filed over losses in its employees ' 401 ( k ) retirement plan , is asking laid - off workers to waive legal claims against it in exchange for some of their severance payments .
attorneys for some of the employees sought to block that requirement . plaintiffs are seeking an "" immediate preliminary injunction prohibiting enron from soliciting any releases which would affect the participants ' rights vis a vis the plan , "" according to an amended complaint filed by seattle firm campbell harrison & wright .

enron , the champion of energy deregulation that grew into one of the nation ' s 10 largest companies , collapsed yesterday , after a rival backed out of a deal to buy it and many big trading partners stopped doing business with it .
enron , based in houston , was widely expected to seek bankruptcy protection . with $ 62 billion in assets as of sept . 30 , it would be the biggest american company ever to go bankrupt , dwarfing the filing by texaco in 1987 . late in the day , though , enron ' s chief financial officer , jeff mcmahon , said that the company was still talking to banks about a restructuring and considering other options .
talks with its would - be rescuer dynegy , also of houston , about salvaging the deal ended in acrimony .
dynegy , which had agreed on nov . 9 to buy enron but had second thoughts as enron disclosed more financial problems and investors pummeled its stock , accused enron of misrepresenting the health of its business . enron , meanwhile , was weighing whether to sue dynegy for breaching the terms of the deal , a person close to enron said .
enron ' s swift collapse left the prospects of 21 , 000 employees in doubt and wiped out what was left of the holdings of stock investors , including some big mutual funds , as shares that sold for $ 90 in august 2000 crashed to close yesterday at 61 cents . it roiled the treasury market and tarnished the standing of the big new york banks that both advised on the deal and poured their own cash into the company . and it left in tatters the reputation of enron ' s chief executive , kenneth l . lay , a confidant and campaign backer of president george w . bush . [ page cl . ]
the treasury department , the federal reserve and the federal energy regulatory commission said they had monitored enron ' s impact on the financial and energy markets yesterday ; officials who would comment said they saw no dangerous ripple effect .
' ' the markets are functioning normally , ' ' said peter bakstansky , a spokesman for the federal reserve bank of new york .
from a pipeline company in the 1980 ' s , enron grew into the world ' s largest energy trader , using the internet to buy and sell natural gas and electric power supplies for utilities and industrial power users and helping them hedge against fluctuations in power prices .
but enron was undone by shaky accounting , too much borrowed money and an unwillingness to provide information to investors who grew to doubt its financial reports .
five weeks ago , the company disclosed that , to fuel its growth , it had shifted billions of dollars in debt off its balance sheet and into an array of complex partnerships . the securities and exchange commission began an investigation , and enron restated five years of earnings , wiping out nearly $ 600 million in profit .
enron was teetering close to insolvency before dynegy , a smaller cross - town rival , agreed to acquire it for $ 9 billion plus the assumption of $ 13 billion in debt , with additional financing from chevrontexaco , a major dynegy shareholder .
but enron subsequently disclosed even more debts , and its financial plight continued to worsen . energy - trading companies reduced dealings with the firm ; doubting its creditworthiness , some forced enron to pay higher prices for natural gas and other products or required it to post large cash deposits to back trades .
for four days , enron and dynegy worked to salvage the deal . but yesterday morning , dynegy pulled out . ' ' we knew when to say no , and this morning , we said no , ' ' said chuck watson , dynegy ' s chairman .
in an interview , mr . watson said enron ' s energy - trading business had deteriorated . he also cited ' ' surprises ' ' in the quarterly report to the s . e . c . that enron filed on nov . 19 , including the disclosures that a credit downgrade meant enron had to pay or refinance a $ 690 million obligation and that enron had less cash on hand than dynegy had expected . ' ' confidence and credibility , which is what this business is all about , deteriorated after that , ' ' he said .
mr . watson said he called mr . lay yesterday after a meeting of dynegy ' s board to call off the deal . by then , s . dynegy shares fell $ 4 . 08 , or 10 percent , to close at $ 36 . 81 .
other big energy traders , like the el paso corporation , reliant energy , mirant and aquila , also fell . but enron ' s gradual decline over the last month gave many energy companies time to reduce their exposure to enron , and many operate rival trading operations that would benefit from its collapse .
yesterday morning , as news leaked out of dynegy ' s plans to cancel the deal and s . prices soar . dec . 15 2000 : four months after the chief executive of azurix resigns , enron takes the company private again . aug . 14 , 2001 : only six months after becoming chief executive , jeffrey k . skilling resigns . he is succeeded by kenneth l . lay . oct . 8 : four years after buying portland general electric , enron agrees to sell it to northwest natural gas oct . 16 : enron reports a third - quarter loss of $ 618 million . oct . 24 : two days after enron discloses that the securities and exchange commission is looking into complicated transactions involving enron and partnerships set up by andrew s . fastow , the company ' s chief financial officer , mr . fastow is forced out . oct . 31 : the s . e . c . upgrades its inquiry to a formal investigation . nov . 8 : enron discloses that it overstated profits for the previous five years by $ 586 million . nov . 9 : dynegy agrees to buy enron for about $ 9 billion . yesterday : the merger collapses . enron ' s stock falls $ 3 . 50 to 61 cents .

enron ' s collapse : the last resort
a bankruptcy filing might be the best remaining choice

enron , facing the collapse of a deal with dynegy that might have rescued it from disaster and a tidal wave of debts suddenly coming due , may now have little choice but to enter bankruptcy , lawyers and analysts said yesterday .
filing for protection under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code would give the company some much - needed breathing room to deal with creditors ' claims , as well as afford any eventual buyer the advantage of a court ' s approval .
but bankruptcy would also be complicated by the fact that some of enron ' s most valuable assets , including its transwestern pipeline linking texas natural gas fields with california energy markets , are already pledged to lenders . the value of other assets available to satisfy unsecured creditors is unclear .
still , enron ' s creditors will not necessarily lose everything , said robert j . rosenberg , a lawyer at latham any awards would not be paid until after creditors were satisfied . and like enron ' s other shareholders , they might end up with nothing , said robert d . albergotti , a partner at haynes & boone , a dallas law firm .
if enron files for bankruptcy , this is not likely to prevent litigation against arthur andersen , the company ' s outside auditor , said jeffrey n . gordon of columbia university law school . indeed , bankruptcy proceedings could give both the company and investors an opportunity to figure out exactly how its profits came to be overstated and to look for potential fraud .
a special committee of enron ' s board has already retained deloitte & touche , another big accounting firm , to help .
' ' it ' s going to be a while before they figure it all out , ' ' professor gordon said .

an implosion on wall street

enron , the energy - trading company , may be on the verge of extinction with the collapse yesterday of its proposed acquisition by dynegy , a smaller competitor , and the downgrading of its debt to junk status . but its name has attained immortality on wall street .
enron is now shorthand for the perfect financial storm . take a high - flying company terribly impressed with its sense of unique mission and ingenuity , and correspondingly contemptuous of its obligations to fully comply with the spirit of accounting rules . then add fawning investors , wall street analysts , journalists and accountants unwilling to allow a company ' s lack of transparency about its business to get in the way of a dizzying ride , until they realize the destination is the top of a steep cliff . what you have then is an enron .
there have been plenty of other once - unfathomable implosions on wall street , but perhaps none so sudden or of such magnitude . jittery financial markets now have to contend with the possibility that an enron bankruptcy could undermine the financial health of banks and other energy companies . enron ranked seventh on the list of fortune 500 companies last year , and remained one of the most hyped stories on wall street well into this year . a pioneer in creating private marketplaces for newly deregulated commodities , enron was touted as a revolutionary force , bridging the dot - com world and stodgy energy markets .
now enron may become one of the largest bankruptcy cases in history . its stock closed yesterday at 61 cents , as investors rushed for the exits in reaction to the fatal news that , without a bailout from dynegy , enron is unlikely to be able to meet its crushing debt obligations .
the company ' s autopsy will be a complicated affair , entailing numerous lawsuits . what is already clear , and will come as a shock to millions of trusting individual investors across america , is that the financials of a fortune 500 company were essentially a mystery . enron ' s death watch began last month when it grudgingly disclosed that $ 1 . 2 billion of its market value had vanished as a result of ' ' related - party ' ' transactions with private partnerships that enriched company insiders . then enron admitted that it had overstated its profits over the last five years by $ 600 million . dynegy cited enron ' s lack of forthrightness as a reason to walk away from the merger agreement .
not very long ago , competitors and democrats in washington were worrying whether the close ties between enron ' s chairman , kenneth lay , and george w . bush would give the company too much influence . enron has aggressively lobbied , with some success in recent years , to limit regulation and disclosure of its trading operations .
now enron is the best argument for the need for stronger supervision of public companies ' financial data . the securities and exchange commission should make sure that the energy trader ' s saga puts an end to any talk of lessening disclosure requirements faced by public companies . moreover , arthur andersen ' s failure to uncover flawed accounting by enron , or to forcefully question some of the company ' s shadier transactions , raises serious concerns about auditors ' commitment to be sufficiently diligent in reviewing the actions of major companies .
there is a certain irony that enron , a champion of deregulation , now becomes a poster child for the need for strong regulation on wall street .

enron ' s collapse : the lenders
citigroup and j . p . morgan are left with bruised egos and exposure to loans

dynegy ' s decision to walk away from enron leaves citigroup and j . p . morgan chase licking their wounds after an effort to burnish their reputations as deal makers .
as lead advisers and lead bankers for enron , the banks had the chance to build influence in the merger business . unlike other wall street firms , citigroup and j . p . morgan have large balance sheets and have boasted of their ability to provide both loans and advice . j . p . morgan , in particular , ' ' has been saying that providing financing is an advantage they have in terms of building their investment banking franchise , ' ' said richard strauss , a goldman , sachs analyst following brokerage firms .
now , not only have the banks lost bragging rights for pulling off a difficult deal , as well as millions in fees , they are also left holding hundreds of millions in loans to enron , which is trying to stave off bankruptcy . enron owes the two banks anywhere from $ 800 million to $ 900 million each , although some of it may be hedged through derivatives contracts , analysts estimated .
in bankruptcy , of course , creditors come well ahead of shareholders , who have now been virtually wiped out . janus capital was the biggest shareholder for most of the year , but alliance capital surpassed it as of sept . 30 , according to the latest regulatory filing available . enron ' s stock plunged to 61 cents yesterday .
worries about the money enron owes the banks punished their stocks yesterday . citigroup ' s shares closed at $ 47 . 80 each , down $ 2 . 75 , while j . p . morgan fell $ 2 . 30 , to $ 37 . 50 .
even if enron files for bankruptcy , neither j . p . morgan nor citigroup is thought to have enough exposure to be at serious risk . executives of the banks declined to comment on the estimates of their exposure . while the banks had each promised to make equity investments in the companies of $ 250 million each , those investments have been canceled along with the dynegy deal .
about half of the money owed to j . p . morgan and citigroup consists of a $ 1 billion loan the banks made earlier this month that is secured by one of enron ' s pipelines . citigroup lent $ 600 million , and j . p . morgan provided the rest , according to an executive close to the enron negotiations . the remainder owed to the banks is in various loans , trading positions and other investments not secured by enron assets .
given that there are assets backing much of the banks ' loans , some analysts said the stock market had overreacted . ' ' the net exposure could be very small , ' ' said andrew collins , who covers bank stocks at u . s . bancorp piper jaffray and is recommending citigroup and j . p . morgan .
jeffrey mcmahon , enron ' s chief financial officer , said the company was still working with j . p . morgan chase and citigroup to restructure enron ' s debts .
several other banks may own large amounts of enron debt . bank of america has $ 200 million to $ 300 million , according to estimates by lori appelbaum , who follows bank stocks for goldman , sachs , and ruchi madan , a stock analyst at salomon smith barney . other banks identified by the analysts as owed money are the bank of new york , bank one , fleetboston financial , suntrust and the wachovia corporation . a spokesman for suntrust did not return calls ; executives at the other banks declined to comment .
in what appears to have been bad timing , alliance capital management , a subsidiary of axa , increased its stake in enron late this summer . janus , a unit of stilwell financial , had been the biggest shareholder , but was pruning its stake . alliance ' s position grew 71 percent in the report filed in september , to 5 . 8 percent of enron ' s outstanding . jane ingalls , a spokeswoman for janus , said last night that janus had since sold all its shares , but did not say when or at what price . a spokesman for alliance would not comment about its stake in enron .

enron ' s collapse : the market
in turbulent bond market , enron ' s woes exacerbate turmoil
by gretchen morgenson

the swift downfall of enron has contributed to extreme turbulence in the united states treasury market in recent weeks , causing violent swings in interest rates not seen since russia defaulted on its debt and the long - term capital management hedge fund nearly collapsed in late 1998 .
even though the exact makeup of enron ' s large trading portfolio remains a mystery , traders said that the energy company had bet that interest rates would continue to decline because of continuing weakness in the economy .
then two weeks ago , the economy began to show signs of revival . as investors decided that the days of federal reserve rate cuts were over , rates began to rise and prices on treasury securities fell . the move out of treasuries crushed traders who still expected the weak economy to push interest rates lower . scrambling to cut their losses , those traders sold even more , depressing prices and pushing up rates further .
the sense among many market participants is that enron ' s woes made a bad market excruciating . ' ' i think the street in general lost half of its year or more in the last week or two , ' ' said stan jonas , managing director at fimat usa , a broker dealer . ' ' everyone was long the bond market , thinking the economy was going to be bad . then everything shifted , and enron drove it to extremes . ' '
how extreme ? in the two weeks beginning nov . 12 , two - year treasury notes plummeted in price , pushing their yields up to 3 . 18 percent , from 2 . 41 percent . in the same period , yields on treasuries with five - year maturities went to 4 . 4 percent , from 3 . 62 percent .
the trade that appears to have gone awry for enron , market participants say , involved the sale of hundreds of thousands of eurodollar futures , some of which matured in two or three years . such contracts are frequently used to bet on the direction of interest rates . enron could also have used the eurodollar contracts to hedge against fluctuations in oil prices . in a weak economy , oil prices usually fall . but so do interest rates , so a bet on lower rates would produce gains to help offset the decline in oil prices . when data showed signs of life in the economy , traders surmised that enron began to sell its eurodollars and started an avalanche of selling among other traders .
there were huge eurodollar positions being liquidated , said gemma wright , director of market strategy at barclays capital . ' ' we don ' t know for certain who it was , but the amount of the loss was high . ' '
one reason that traders suspect enron may have been forced out of such a position was that the company had neither the cash flow nor the bank credit to meet calls for additional cash from traders at other firms . typically , companies have cash reserves to meet such calls or have access to temporary lines of credit to cover shortfalls . enron appears to have neither . yesterday , the company said it was suspending all payments except for those ' ' necessary to maintain core operations . ' '
in addition to the recent interest rate spike , enron has had to contend with falling oil prices . the price of crude oil has dropped 28 percent since the end of october .
caught in a vise , enron has almost certainly been selling securities to raise cash . treasury securities and eurodollar contracts , because their markets are large , are among the easiest to sell . in both cases , enron was probably selling into a falling market .
adding to the turmoil in the bond market , traders said , was less participation by wall street firms , which were unwilling to take on big new trading positions near the end of their fiscal year . several firms end their years on nov . 30 .
some traders say enron ' s problems started with comments on tuesday by laurence h . meyer , a governor of the federal reserve . mr . meyer suggested that additional rate cuts might be coming , and that remark helped stabilize prices of treasury securities . ' ' it ' s my view that there are no coincidences , ' ' mr . jonas said . ' ' laurence meyer is a big hawk on interest rates , and he basically talked a 180 . that was their big gun . the only bigger gun would have been greenspan . ' '

enron ' s collapse : market place
a big fall evoking nasty old memories of a run on a bank
by floyd norris
11 / 29 / 2001
the new york times
page 1 , column 1
c . 2001 new york times company
the final collapse of enron amounted to something that few living americans have ever seen : a bank run like those in the days before deposit insurance .
enron appeared to become a wildly successful company by creating a new , largely unregulated financial business , that of energy trading . that business ran on credit , and required suppliers and users of energy to sign contracts that called on enron to meet obligations months or years later .
enron became something like a bank , which takes depositors ' money and promises to pay it back later . but unlike banks in the current era , this institution had no federal deposit insurance to reassure customers when rumors began to spread that it was in trouble . that proved to be its achilles ' heel . enron ' s collapse is a reminder for big players in unregulated markets that their financial health must be beyond doubt .
before the advent of deposit insurance , bankers knew what was needed to head off a bank run . it was cash , so much cash that it would be clear that panic was unwarranted . nearly a century ago , j . p . morgan took the lead as he and fellow banking tycoons put up the millions needed to keep the trust company of america open . thus was halted the panic of 1907 .
as it happened , corporate descendants of two major institutions involved in that rescue - - j . p . morgan chase and citigroup - - were major players in the enron debacle . but they did not try the strategy this time .
instead , enron kept arranging an additional billion or two in loans , clearly struggling to find the money . morgan and citigroup allowed the word to spread that they were ready to put in more money on their own , but the amounts were relatively small , and somehow the money was never invested .
when dynegy agreed to buy enron , it put up $ 1 . 5 billion in cash only after it was assured that it would get control of the company ' s crown jewel , the northern natural gas pipeline system , or its money back , if the deal collapsed .
the final straw came on tuesday , when negotiations on a revised dynegy takeover deal came down to efforts to find $ 250 million or $ 500 million of enron assets that could serve as collateral for a new dynegy cash advance . the message to companies that traded with enron was clear : even its rescuer is demanding collateral , and is having trouble finding it .
given that , enron ' s financial business could not continue . public haggling over the terms of the rescue assured that no rescue was possible , something that would have been obvious to the original j . p . morgan but that seemed to escape his corporate heirs . as walter bagehot , the british financial journalist and historian , wrote in 1873 , ' ' every banker knows that if he has to prove that he is worthy of credit , however good may be his arguments , in fact his credit is gone . ' '
the markets enron helped to create will endure , but probably without enron . it will be interesting to see whether participants in them continue to resist regulation as much as they have in the past . unregulated markets , especially when they are relatively new , can be very profitable for those with superior market knowledge , as enron seemed to have . but when prices are visible to all , the value of that knowledge plummets . regulation could bring more openness , but it could also bring structures , like clearing systems , that reassure traders they need not worry about the credit of those with whom they trade .
if the markets continue to be unregulated , enron ' s collapse makes it more likely that the big players in those markets will be companies that are already regulated enough to assure customers that they are secure - - companies like major banks and brokerage houses . that would be bad news for dynegy , which was enron ' s major competitor before it tried to become its acquirer .
the crisis at enron may have exposed a ' ' flaw in the business model ' ' of energy trading companies , said john diaz , a managing director at moody ' s , in an interview yesterday . ' ' companies in this industry need to think carefully about their liquidity management , ' ' he said . ' ' we ' re going to be looking very hard at this . ' '
the litigation over enron seems likely to be prolonged and expensive , but it may boil down to senator howard h . baker jr . ' s famous watergate - era question about president richard m . nixon : what did he know and when did he know it ?
that question will be asked about arthur andersen , enron ' s auditor , and about its corporate officials , past and present . but it will be asked most particularly about the banks and investment banks that served enron and its affiliated off - balance - sheet entities in recent years .
enron ' s disclosures last week showed it needed to pay far more in debts over the next year than most people had understood to be the case . but the newly discovered loans did not materialize out of thin air . the money was lent by banks and bond buyers to the off - balance - sheet entities . those who were stuck with losses on the known enron debt may claim the financiers who syndicated the loans should have told them of all the other debt .
among those who do not come out of this looking very good are the bond rating agencies . just six weeks ago , after enron put out an earnings release showing strong pro - forma profits , as it defined them , two of the agencies , fitch and standard & poor ' s , reaffirmed enron ' s rating of triple - b plus . moody ' s , the agency that was the most skeptical about enron , put the rating under review and hinted it would , at worst , cut it one notch .
none of the rating agencies seemed overly concerned about a detail disclosed by enron at the time : a $ 1 . 2 billion reduction in shareholder equity related to what it later said were accounting mistakes involving a partnership run by enron ' s chief financial officer . but that disclosure set off a cascade of questions that enron could not answer in a reassuring way . it ran through billions as companies demanded more protection to keep trading with it .
enron could have been saved , if an institution that was trusted - - whether that was chevron texaco , which put up the $ 1 . 5 billion cash that dynegy invested , or j . p . morgan chase or citigroup - - had made it clear that it was willing to stand behind enron . a credible backer would have ended the run .
but no one was willing to do that , and their hesitance as they learned more only accelerated the run . whether they were wise to avoid that exposure may become clear as it emerges how much creditors will eventually get .
finally , the rating agencies yesterday downgraded enron to relatively low levels of junk . they knew that was likely to force enron into bankruptcy in the near future , but they also knew that no one was willing to rescue a company that the agencies had viewed as solid only weeks before .
yesterday , as dynegy walked away from the merger , it said that it was no longer willing to trade with enron - - unless enron put up ' ' sufficient credit support . ' ' it knew that support was nowhere to be found .

enron ' s collapse : the chief executive
foundation gives way on chief ' s big dream

well before anyone could imagine that enron might collapse , kenneth l . lay was stumped . in an interview in august , he dismissed questions about a vague clause in the energy company ' s annual report that hinted at bigger problems if its stock price or credit rating fell below certain levels .
' ' i just can ' t help you on that , ' ' he said . pressed further on questions about a bewildering constellation of business partnerships that involved enron ' s former chief financial officer , he said , ' ' you ' re getting way over my head . ' '
at the least , mr . lay - - a man of big ideas , a crusader for free markets , a risk taker in the texas wildcatter tradition - - had taken his eye off the ball . while he was busy befriending the nation ' s most powerful politicians , erecting one of the tallest buildings in houston and pasting enron ' s logo on the city ' s new ballpark , the little things were turning out to be mr . lay ' s big problems .
one after another , disclosures spilled out of his company over the last month : the partnerships had hidden billions in debt ; years of enron ' s reported profits had been exaggerated ; the government was investigating . rivals were shunning enron ' s energy trading desks , which mr . lay had built into the world ' s leaders . and sure enough , the stock price tumbled day after day , and credit agencies lowered enron ' s ratings once and then yesterday again , turning the company ' s debt to junk and its shares into a penny stock .
three weeks ago , mr . lay tried to salvage his creation by selling it to dynegy , his houston rival . yesterday , dynegy pulled out of the deal . deprived of enough information , and then repelled by what they learned , the free markets in which mr . lay had put so much faith all but destroyed , in a matter of weeks , everything he had built .
' ' if they had been going a slower speed , the results would not have been disastrous , ' ' said bob mcnair , a houston energy entrepreneur who sold the bulk of his own company to enron three years ago . but enron , he said in an interview this month , was like a race car , and the markets like an unforgiving track . ' ' it ' s a lot harder to keep it on the track at 200 miles per hour , ' ' he said . ' ' you hit a bump and you ' re off the track . ' '
from his youth , mr . lay , 59 , had nurtured an abiding faith in the markets ' wisdom . he studied economics at the university of missouri , living at home to save on room and board , and eventually earned a ph . d . in the subject . as a naval officer serving in the pentagon , he worked to develop more efficient accounting systems . later , he served as an aide to a federal government regulator for the natural gas industry - - a market that enron would come to dominate .
moving into the private sector , he worked his way up the ranks of the natural gas industry , becoming chief executive in 1984 of the houston natural gas corporation , a big regional pipeline operator . he engineered its merger with internorth , an omaha pipeline company , and then became chief executive of the combined company and changed its name to enron .
mr . lay saw enron ' s mission as far more than being a conduit for fuel . at the time , gas prices were regulated and pipelines played a relatively passive role ; buyers and sellers could not cut deals on the fly . but as oil prices plunged in the mid - 80 ' s and gas users began switching to cheaper fuel oil , mr . lay returned to washington to argue , successfully , for rules changes that he said would save the pipeline business by allowing operators to shop for the best deals from both gas producers and utilities .
the new flexibility brought the threat of chaos , however , as natural gas prices began fluctuating wildly . that is when the new enron was truly born . to help customers shield themselves from risk , mr . lay ' s enron developed hedging contracts for gas like those traded in the markets for corn and copper and winter wheat . its innovative ' ' gas bank ' ' let utilities lock up the long - term prices that they craved ; enron lined up the gas supplies from producers , arranged for delivery - - and took a cut of every deal .
that business became the forerunner of enron ' s entry into hundreds of other markets , helping customers obtain supplies and manage risks in products ranging from electric power to pulp and paper and , most recently , fast broadband access to the internet . trading soon provided more of the company ' s profits than the traditional natural gas business .
while other companies , including dynegy , focused on accumulating hard assets like pipelines , turbines and gas fields , enron increasingly saw itself as a pure trading company with an almost limitless future .
' ' there is a very reasonable chance that we will become the biggest corporation in the world , ' ' mr . lay ' s handpicked successor as enron ' s chief executive , jeffrey k . skilling , told the authors of a book , just published , about business on the internet . even the book ' s title , ' ' radical e : from ge to enron - - lessons on how to rule the web ' ' ( ) , showed the cachet the company had attained . enron , the authors wrote , was ' ' creating a culture in which radical and creative thinking is encouraged and rewarded . ' '
mr . skilling abruptly resigned in august , after just six months on the job , propelling mr . lay back into the gritty details of enron ' s businesses that he had sought to leave to others .
as the company grew , he had become increasingly involved in public affairs , serving as host when a global economic conference was held in houston in 1990 and when the republican national convention came to the city in 1992 .
like the leaders of many big texas businesses - - the construction colossus brown became good friends with the texas governor , ann richards ; and supported senator phil gramm of texas , whose wife , wendy , a former chairwoman of the commodities futures trading commission , joined enron ' s board .
' ' he ' s a stand - up guy , ' ' said ms . richards , now a business consultant in new york . asked to be more specific , she said , ' ' he ' s at the meeting ' ' - - meaning she could count on mr . lay to become directly involved with whatever she asked him to do , and not just sign onto a project for show .
mr . lay ' s deepest political ties were with the bush family . in the 1980 ' s , he became a major fund - raiser for george h . w . bush . when mr . bush lost his 1992 campaign for re - election as president , mr . lay brought a number of senior bush aides to enron as directors or consultants , including james a . baker iii , the former secretary of state , and robert a . mosbacher , the former secretary of commerce .
mr . lay also cultivated mr . bush ' s son george w . long before he was considered a serious national candidate . after the younger mr . bush ' s election as texas governor in 1994 , mr . lay became head of the governor ' s business council , an important advisory post .
the bond with president bush is personal . as governor , mr . bush sent mr . lay a kidding note in 1997 . ' ' one of the sad things about old friends is that they seem to be getting older - - just like you ! ' ' he wrote . ' ' 55 years old . wow ! that is really old . thank goodness you have such a young , beautiful wife , ' ' he added , a reference to mr . lay ' s wife , linda .
in 1999 , mr . lay sent a handwritten christmas note to mr . bush and his wife , laura . ' ' linda and i are so proud of both of you and look forward to seeing both of you in the white house , ' ' he wrote .
yesterday , the white house press secretary , ari fleischer , said the treasury department was monitoring enron ' s downfall for its effect on the market . asked if the president himself had any reaction , mr . fleisher said , ' ' the president ' s reaction is that it should be monitored . ' '
in some ways , enron ' s collapse was one more example of the bursting of the internet bubble . but mr . lay was not some stylish dot - com brat ; by all accounts , he is an immensely likable product of middle america . growing up in tiny rush hill , mo . , he was driving a tractor by age 12 and salting away savings . by 16 , his sister sharon recalled this week , ' ' he was bucking bales ' ' - - that is , loading hay - - ' ' and had two jobs in the summer , painting houses . ' '
' ' i don ' t think you could ever say that he did something the easy way , ' ' she said .
that work ethic ran in the family . mr . lay ' s father was a minister who also sold farm equipment . the family ' s finances were spotty , ' ' at times no money , at times some money , ' ' ms . lay recalled . still , the lays took in people from their church who were in need .
over the last decade or so , mr . lay earned some $ 300 million from enron , mostly by exercising stock options . earlier this month , when employees grew incensed at the prospect of his collecting a big severance package with the company ' s sale to dynegy , he volunteered to walk away from $ 60 million in payments .
mr . mcnair , the houston entrepreneur , who has known mr . lay for years , suggested that perhaps everything had not been disclosed to him . ' ' maybe the people who reported to him told him what they wanted him to hear , but they weren ' t telling him everything , ' ' he said .
mr . mcnair said he spoke to mr . lay recently and found him ' ' somewhat in a state of shock . ' ' mr . mcnair added , ' ' he ' s devastated . ' '
in the end , it seems , the man whose company did so much to help others manage their risk could not manage his own .

enron ' s collapse : the derivatives
market that deals in risks faces a novel one

c . 2001 new york times company
when members of the international swaps and derivatives association gathered in washington last april , the man they all wanted to hear was jeffrey k . skilling , then the president and chief executive of enron .
enron had helped create the global market for energy - based derivatives - - customized risk - swapping contracts that enable companies to hedge their exposure to changing energy prices and supply fluctuations . even among traders more familiar with interest - rate swaps or currency hedges than energy contracts , mr . skilling ' s presentation did not disappoint .
' ' he dazzled everybody - - it seemed he could figure out a way to trade the minutes on this phone call , ' ' one industry executive said .
but yesterday , many of those same executives were crossing their fingers and hoping that enron ' s crisis would not spread into the energy swaps market that the company had done so much to enliven .
as the day ended with fairly stable trading , there were a few cautious sighs of relief . but nobody is quite sure just how much money the energy - related derivatives markets will have at risk if enron fails .
according to swaps monitor publications , which collects data for the derivatives markets , enron ranks among the top energy - swaps traders in the world , on a par with financial giants like bank of america and barclay ' s .
at the end of september , enron ' s gross derivatives trading liabilities - - the amount of money it would owe to other market players if it filed for bankruptcy - - stood at $ 18 . 7 billion , up slightly from june levels but about $ 1 . 3 billion less than at the end of last year .
but that level may overstate the risk to other companies . ' ' these numbers do not take into account the unknown amount of collateral that enron may have posted , ' ' said paul spraos , swaps monitor ' s president . such collateral should , in principle , diminish enron ' s actual liabilities to the derivatives market , he said .
in a typical energy swap , a company will enter into a contract to lock in a fixed price of a certain commodity , like natural gas or electricity . the other company , the counterparty , in the deal assumes the risk of future price changes and quotes a fixed price that includes its own profit . the efficient trading and pricing of these contracts requires a marketplace with large , active traders .
as of last night , there were no signs of a major panic that would drive major participants to the sidelines , industry executives said .
' ' it ' s not likely that enron ' s problems will cause serious difficulty for any other sizable counterparty , ' ' said mark c . brickell , a veteran swaps - market executive and the chief executive of blackbird , a technology firm that operates an electronic swaps - trading system . ' ' while there may be some smaller firm that didn ' t manage its exposure as well as it might , that won ' t cause any major problems for the system as a whole . ' '
michael williams , managing director of tradespark , a rival to enron ' s online energy - trading system , agreed that there was ' ' no sign of shrinkage ' ' in the marketplace yesterday . ' ' so far , we ' ve seen no complaints about a lack of liquidity , ' ' he added .
most participants in the energy derivatives market rely on a standard contract that was developed by the international swaps and derivatives association and is recognized in the courts . the contract clearly specifies the rights each party has in the event of a default , said robert pickel , the association ' s chief executive . as of late yesterday , he added , the markets appeared ' ' to be fairly resilient in the face of extremely negative developments regarding such a major player . ' '
but at least one lawyer who specializes in swaps contracts indicated that it might be too soon to assess the full impact . that lawyer , ann o ' hara , in lincoln , neb . , said that her clients ' anxiety about enron had escalated sharply only in the last few days . ' ' no one believed it would really happen , ' ' she said . ' ' it is not a surprise , but it is a shock . ' '
' ' we don ' t really know who is out there exposed to enron ' s credit , ' ' she added . ' ' i ' m telling my clients to prepare for the worst . ' '

enron ' s collapse : the rating agencies
debt rankings finally fizzle , but the deal fizzled first
by alex berenson

the new york times

c . 2001 new york times company
in the end , the rating agencies hardly mattered .
for weeks , wall street wondered whether moody ' s investors service , standard & poor ' s and fitch ' s , the three major agencies rating corporate debt , would drop enron ' s rating below investment grade .
enron and dynegy warned that cutting the rating might jeopardize dynegy ' s acquisition of enron . executives at big securities firms that stood to profit from the deal pressed moody ' s to keep ratings at investment grade , even as enron bonds fell to levels indicating that the debt was highly risky .
but even an investment - grade rating could not save enron ' s business from collapse over the last month . after a series of damaging revelations about enron ' s finances , the company ' s partners demanded extra capital for its trades or stopped trading with it . by the time the rating agencies decided yesterday that enron might well default on its debt , dynegy had decided on its own to walk away .
' ' it wasn ' t really the reason that dynegy backed out of the deal , ' ' said todd shipman , the standard & poor ' s analyst who was the first to cut enron ' s rating yesterday .
the cuts dim the hopes enron had of avoiding bankruptcy . all three agencies slashed enron ' s debt far below investment grade . moody ' s cut enron ' s rating 5 notches , standard & poor ' s lowered it 6 , and fitch slashed it 10 , to cc , its third - lowest grade .
' ' default is a probability , ' ' said glen grabelsky , the senior director of credit policy for fitch . enron has $ 13 billion in debt outstanding and about $ 10 billion more in loans , made by partnerships , that the company has guaranteed .
the aggressive rating cuts may not mollify the investors who have sharply criticized the agencies for being slow to act in recent weeks . officials at all three agencies defended themselves yesterday , saying they had acted prudently .
after dynegy agreed to buy enron , moody ' s tried to calculate the chances that the deal would go through , that enron would remain strong until it was completed and that the combined company would carry a strong rating , said john diaz , managing director for moody ' s power and energy group .
at first , those questions seemed to have reassuring answers , mr . diaz said , so moody ' s kept enron ' s investment - grade rating .
but in recent days , other companies have shied away from doing business with enron , and its losses have soared . ' ' basic cash flow was slowing down at the same time that the cost structure of the company was the same , ' ' mr . diaz said . enron ' s mounting losses discouraged dynegy , he said .
' ' over the last 24 hours , the probability that we ' ve assigned to these three key issues was looking to be a lot smaller , ' ' mr . diaz said .
mr . grabelsky said the acquisition uncertainty presented the agencies with a situation where enron ' s debt could be very strong , if the deal worked , or highly risky .
' ' there is no middle ground , ' ' he said . ' ' it ' s one or the other . ' '

although these are just single - digit positions , a loss from par value to 20 cents on the dollar in a 4 per cent holding could trim off half of a fund ' s return , said scott berry , morningstar bond fund analyst .
the average intermediate bond fund has returned 7 . 3 per cent so far this year , according to morningstar . a loss from par value to 20 cents on the dollar in a 4 per cent stake could reduce a 7 . 3 per cent return to roughly 3 . 3 per cent , mr berry said .
"" with bonds , there ' s much more downside than upside . typically , the downside is never realised because these investment - grade bonds are strong enough to weather the storm , but enron just caught everybody by surprise over the last couple of months , "" he said .
other large investment - grade bond funds that held enron ' s debt as of their most recent filings include the $ 13 . 6 bn fidelity short term bond fund , which held 0 . 77 per cent , worth $ 27 . 7 m as of april 30 , and two of the strong funds - the $ 1 . 36 m strong corporate bond fund , which held 0 . 77 per cent as of september 30 , or $ 10 . 5 m , and the $ 1 . 43 bn strong short term bond fund , with a 0 . 63 per cent holding , also as of september 30 , worth $ 9 m .
mr berry said managers of investment - grade bond funds that still held the debt were probably selling it , although most had the latitude to hold a bond once it lost its investment - grade status . however , they also said junk - bond fund managers were unlikely to buy it , because other "" fallen angel "" bonds such as xerox had not performed well .

companies & finance the americas - sec filing triggered merger crisis .

dynegy ' s rescue bid for enron went into "" crisis mode "" 10 days ago , said chuck watson , dynegy ' s chairman and chief executive .
in a filing to the sec , enron revealed a previously undisclosed $ 690 m note payment due this week , as well as that it had $ 9 . 15 bn in debt due by the end of next year . the news provoked another round of selling in enron ' s already plunging share price , forcing dynegy into 18 - hour a day talks that ran through the thanksgiving weekend and up to midnight on tuesday . .
"" that may have been the last straw to some shareholders , "" mr watson said just hours after withdrawing from dynegy ' s $ 9 bn merger with enron . enron had been the biggest energy trader in the us until a crisis of confidence , beginning in october , that pushed it to the brink of bankruptcy .
"" every time we thought we had the pieces , "" he said . "" every time we put the puzzle together it wasn ' t a clear strategy to go forward . ""
he said the talks resumed yesterday at 7 am , but when the rating agencies began downgrading enron to junk status , mr watson called ken lay , enron ' s chairman and chief executive , to say "" it wasn ' t going to work "" .
"" once they downgraded the company , we thought , what was already an uphill battle , was too difficult , "" he said . mr watson said he offered to help any way he could and the two men - who have long been friendly , cross - town rivals - parted amicably .
mr watson has received several calls from other counter - parties in the business , thanking him for saving them from a meltdown by giving them the time to limit their exposure to enron . "" i don ' t feel like a saviour , i feel tired , "" he said . but he acknowledged he provided a vast number of enron ' s counterparties , partners and customers a chance to better protect themselves against enron ' s demise .
"" there was a really strong effort to make it happen , "" he said . "" in the end , we couldn ' t find a solution that didn ' t risk dynegy ' s responsibility to its shareholders and to its employees . ""
he says the merger agreement allows it to walk away with enron ' s most valuable asset , the northern natural gas pipeline , though if enron disputes that , at worst , it would leave with money invested in saving enron . "" we are as solid as we were going into ( the merger ) and , maybe , better for the experience , "" he said .

companies & finance the americas - financial system braces for a chain reaction .

gary silverman .
enron ' s woes are raising risks for the financial system , threatening to set off a chain reaction in the markets that could damage any number of participants in unforeseen ways .
individual banks could lose hundreds of millions of dollars apiece on loans to enron , but regulators are confident the lenders have sufficient capital to weather such a storm .
the bigger worry is that enron ' s difficulties could trigger ripple effects in much the same way as russia ' s default in 1998 destabilised the long - term capital management hedge fund .
prices for banking stocks tumbled yesterday in new york and london , in large part because no one really knows what would happen if enron were removed from the financial scene .
enron sat on a massive trading book , made up of complex derivatives transactions , some meant to stay in place for decades . on the other side were a host of counterparties , many of them energy companies that are not supervised by banking regulators .
the counterparties , in turn , have their own set of borrowing and trading relationships with banks that may be completely unaware of their customers ' ties to enron . bankers also fear that because so many of these counterparties were new to sophisticated trading , they may have been lax in collateralising their deals .
for leading banks , enron ' s woes could result in big hits to profits . just about every big lending bank has exposure to enron , according to members of the bank group .
at a meeting of enron ' s creditors last week , one banker estimated there could have been 500 bankers representing 20 or more banks .
jp morgan chase and citigroup are the most prominent members of the bank group , but barclays , credit lyonnais , credit suisse first boston , deutsche bank and many others are exposed .
it was understood that jp morgan chase ' s direct exposure to enron approaches $ 900 m , about $ 500 m of it unsecured by the energy company ' s assets . citigroup ' s direct exposure could reach $ 800 m , about half unsecured .
european banks also could take hits . according to data from loanware , for example , westlb , the german state - owned bank , has a $ 580 m bridge facility outstanding . this was extended as trade financing last year and does not appear to have been syndicated .
however , analysts caution that determining the exposure of a particular bank to enron is virtually impossible for outsiders . many loans are syndicated or sold , and bankers are also making increasing use of credit derivatives that enable them to buy insurance against default from counterparties .
barclays , for example , is one of the most active arrangers of finance for enron but it has syndicated most of its initial exposure . its exposure is estimated at less than # 250 m ( $ 356 m ) . on the other hand , banks could be exposed to firms that dealt with enron , which sold credit default insurance to its trading partners , according to market participants .
investors rerated banking stocks yesterday to account for expected exposures . citigroup was down $ 2 . 75 , or 5 . 4 per cent , to $ 47 . 80 , while jp morgan was down $ 2 . 30 , or 5 . 78 per cent , to $ 37 . 50 . in london , shares in barclays fell 4 per cent , or 86 p , to 2093 p . additional reporting by joshua chaffin in new york and rebecca bream in london .

companies & finance the americas - traders avoid exposure to junk status fallout .

energy traders on both sides of the atlantic were doing very little business with enron even before credit rating agencies demoted the debt of the world ' s biggest power trader to junk status .
rivals have been anxiously calculating their potential exposure to an enron collapse for at least a month - since the true extent of the company ' s crisis emerged .
most traders before yesterday were only prepared to be buyers of electricity and gas from the group , on the basis that it was better to owe than be owed in these circumstances .
"" there would have been very few sellers to enron , "" said one trader last night .
the group accounts for about 25 per cent of energy trading in the us with a similar market share in the smaller european market .
the loss of such a large player could cause liquidity problems in the us , said one analyst .
europe - based energy groups , however , felt there was sufficient capacity in their market to fill the gap .
more worrying is the knock - on effect particularly on smaller companies should enron be unable to honour long - term contracts , said brian senior , director of trading and asset management at innogy , the uk arm of the demerged national power .
the collapse of enron ' s credit rating means that it may have to provide a lot of cash as collateral to cover long - term liabilities , with money being due as early as next monday , said mr senior .
most large energy groups stopped trading with enron in european markets two days ago .
"" the simplest thing is to pull the plug until they ' ve figured out what ' s going on , "" said one analyst .
martin stanley , president of european energy trading for txu , another large us energy group , said : "" we have halted trading with enron . we are sorry to see it happen because they are a very innovative company . ""
even before yesterday ' s events , txu , like other large traders , had been adding up how much it could be owed and how much it would owe , should enron fail to honour its obligations .
"" we have been looking at various scenarios and have implemented our credit event management process designed to minimise our cash exposure , "" said mr stanley .
"" we are comfortable with our cash position , "" he added .

negotiations over the fate of enron , the us energy trading group , had been described as having "" a lot of moving parts "" . yesterday , those parts finally broke loose as the credit rating agencies ' patience ended with a downgrade of the energy trader ' s debt to junk status , and dynegy , its erstwhile saviour , withdrew .
immediate concern centred on the possibility of a systemic risk to the energy markets . "" it ' s over , isn ' t it ? "" said gerald keenan , a partner at pwc . "" what it is going to engender is a daisy chain of defaults . ""
enrononline , the group ' s much - vaunted web - based commodities trading system , shut down , according to traders . counterparties in the energy market stopped trading with enron altogether . the shares , which at their peak last year traded at $ 90 , fell by nearly three - quarters to just over $ 1 . the bonds , which have been trading at levels consistent with imminent bankruptcy for two weeks , fell further .
enron ' s survival since its much smaller rival , dynegy , launched a rescue bid on november 9 , has depended on a fragile pact between dynegy , chevrontexaco ( which owns 26 per cent of dynegy and backed the bid ) , enron ' s lenders , its trading counterparties and the rating agencies . the logic of this pact was essentially circular .
when dynegy stepped in three weeks ago enron was in the early stages of its crisis of confidence . shareholders had been shocked by enron ' s admission that it would have to shrink shareholders ' funds by $ 1 . 2 bn to end a transaction with an off - balance - sheet vehicle established by andrew fastow , former chief financial officer . suddenly , the lack of transparency they had been prepared to forgive while the shares rose was a liability .
searching for a way to arrest the downward spiral , ken lay , enron ' s chief executive , linked up with chuck watson , his counterpart at dynegy . dynegy ' s all - stock bid - valuing enron , on tuesday ' s closing prices , at $ 9 . 4 bn - was dependent , however , on the rating agencies not downgrading the energy ' s group ' s substantial debts to junk status .
such a downgrade , as enron explained in a regulatory filing last week , would require the group to repay , refinance or provide extra cash as collateral for some $ 3 . 9 bn of debts owed by off - balance - sheet trusts .
under pressure from enron and dynegy ' s bankers , the agencies refrained from downgrading the debt , and dynegy went ahead with its bid . the agencies justified their position by citing the pending bid .
it was an uncomfortable position for the agencies , however , and their resolve began to crumble last week as dynegy and enron talked about renegotiating the deal .
in a tersely worded note issued last wednesday , fitch , another rating agency , pointed out that if dynegy "" steps away entirely from the merger , enron ' s credit situation seems highly untenable with a bankruptcy filing highly possible "" .
yesterday , s & p , then moody ' s and fitch , finally broke the fragile ring of confidence that was holding lenders , bidders and enron itself together . in its note , s & p explained in stark terms how the virtuous circle of confidence might now become a vicious downward spiral .
the collapse of enron securities in capital markets made dynegy less likely to complete its takeover , s & p wrote . at the same time , enron ' s franchise in the energy markets had "" sustained significant damage "" , making it a less attractive target .
if enron does now disintegrate , the question is whether the chain reaction will extend beyond the houston company and drag in other energy traders , or even the banks that finance them . analysts had already begun to liken its situation to that of long - term capital management , whose demise in 1998 prompted the federal reserve to co - ordinate a rescue by wall street banks to avoid a financial crisis .
however , the head of one large commodities trader said the biggest market participants had had long enough to protect themselves from the collapse of enron .
but smaller groups could be affected and the fear is that the complexities of its balance sheet may still contain the seeds of a wider crisis . additional reporting by sheila mcnulty in houston .

new york - - enron corp . ' s lifeline merger deal collapsed wednesday , and the once - mighty energy trader slid toward all - but - certain bankruptcy .
its houston rival and neighbor dynegy inc . called off its planned takeover after wall street ' s major credit - rating agencies slashed enron ' s bonds to "" junk "" status wednesday morning .
investors and enron ' s trading partners had lost confidence well before the rating agencies did . in fact , it was the recent erosion of enron ' s trading business and the harrowing slide in its stock and bond prices that forced the ratings cut and triggered dynegy ' s decision to back out of the deal .
informed sources said dynegy ultimately balked after coming across much more debt than it expected in evaluating enron ' s finances and watching helplessly as the value of its would - be acquisition shrank dramatically when energy customers fled the firm .
with the merger called off , enron was "" exploring other options to protect our core energy businesses , "" kenneth l . lay , the company ' s chairman and chief executive , said in a brief statement that skirted the topic of bankruptcy .
the lack of a decent credit rating cripples enron ' s ability to run its trading business , the franchise that made it one of america ' s most admired companies but also gave it a reputation for arrogance and greed , particularly for its role in california ' s energy crisis .
computer screens went dark nationwide wednesday as the widely used enrononline internet - based trading system shut down .
enron ' s stock , already down 95 % for the year , tumbled $ 3 . 50 to close at 61 cents on wednesday in a trading stampede on the new york stock exchange . a one - day record of 339 million shares changed hands .
the whole company , once worth $ 63 billion , now is valued at less than $ 500 million , or about twice the cost of enron ' s new headquarters under construction in downtown houston .
dynegy shares , meanwhile , sank $ 4 . 92 to $ 35 . 97 , just below where they stood when dynegy agreed to acquire enron on nov . 9 .
dynegy exited the deal because it was "" unwilling to risk our franchise , our credit or our credibility , "" president stephen bergstrom said in a news conference wednesday .
"" we know when to say no , and this morning we said no , "" he said .
wall street had been saying no for days , hammering enron ' s stock to less than half the $ 10 . 41 a share that dynegy originally agreed to pay . dynegy was in the process of renegotiating its price downward when it finally threw in the towel .
the deal ' s lack of credibility with stock and bond investors prompted the top two rating agencies - - standard & poor ' s and moody ' s investors service - - to cut their ratings on enron , knowing that they probably were pronouncing a death sentence .
the ratings downgrade triggered clauses in enron loan agreements that require the company to immediately pay its creditors some $ 3 . 9 billion - - money that it doesn ' t have , analysts said .
the ripples from enron ' s collapse spread far and wide , even to the u . s . treasury market , where some investors fled for safety as enron ' s bonds plunged in value .
enron led a trend in energy trading , creating an internet - based network that allowed millions of suppliers and purchasers of electricity , natural gas , oil and coal to do business with one another . the trades of contracts , often spanning many years at a fixed price range , are intended to protect major users and suppliers of energy from fluctuations in fuel prices .
energy market experts are split on the long - term effects of enron ' s collapse . some say the fallout will be slight , noting that rivals already have stepped in to take over business with trading partners who were too nervous to continue dealing with enron .
"" the whole industry should thank dynegy for basically buying them two or three weeks ' time to unwind their deals with enron , "" said analyst andre meade of commerzbank securities in new york .
but enron was noted for the complexity of its long - term deals , and the effects of its withdrawal as a key player could be far - reaching and unexpected , other analysts said .
banking companies , dozens of which lent money to enron , saw their shares dip on worries about whether those loans will be repaid . shares of rival energy companies , too , lost value .
enron ' s chief lenders - - citigroup inc . and j . p . morgan chase & co . - - each have about $ 800 million in loans that may be at risk in a bankruptcy , said richard strauss , a bank analyst with goldman , sachs ; photo : ( no caption ) ;

houston - - the likely bankruptcy of enron corp . could lead to a host of troubling consequences , including higher wholesale prices for electricity and natural gas and financial distress for banks and other firms as well as major bondholders and other investors , analysts said wednesday .
however , energy trading markets were calm as enron competitors picked up the slack while looking for opportunities to build or expand their own trading operations and acquire enron assets .
the concerns and maneuvering came as dynegy inc . on wednesday canceled its proposed acquisition of enron , once the world ' s largest energy trading company , after enron ' s debts were downgraded to non - investment "" junk "" status , making a bankruptcy filing highly likely .
"" banks are starting to worry about a financial meltdown from an enron collapse , "" said peter fusaro , president of global change , a risk management consultancy in new york .
enron ' s debts , which had been partly hidden in off - balance - sheet partnerships , could total $ 5 billion more than the company ' s assets , experts in new york and houston estimated .
citigroup and j . p . morgan chase , major commercial bankers to enron , will face losses if enron files for bankruptcy , analysts said . shares of citigroup and morgan declined more than 5 % on wednesday . other experts warned that investment banking firms such as goldman sachs and morgan stanley that had been part of enron ' s sophisticated trading network also could run into problems .
as enron , which rose rapidly in recent years to almost $ 200 billion in annual revenue , neared bankruptcy , shareholders faced being wiped out and investors in about $ 9 billion in enron bonds may get only cents on the dollar , analysts said .
enron ' s employees , 15 , 000 of whom hold enron stock in their 401 ( k ) retirement plans , stood to be among the biggest losers in the company ' s collapse . many probably also will lose their jobs .
major lawsuits against enron claiming lack of loyalty and prudence in dealing with its employees are among scores of lawsuits now confronting the company and arthur andersen , the accounting firm that approved enron ' s financial statements . enron is under investigation by the securities and exchange commission for its handling of disclosure of the partnerships and subsidiaries .
and yet as enron ' s crisis approached a possible bankruptcy filing , a brisk optimism prevailed among energy traders . enron competitors were as enthusiastic about opportunities to buy parts of enron as they were fearful of the consequences of the big trader ' s collapse .
stephen baum , chief executive of sempra energy , the san diego - based utility holding company , said enrononline , the houston company ' s highly successful internet - based trading operation , would be acquired by other companies and carry on energy trading in the future .
sempra itself would be interested in discussing formation of such a new online trading firm , baum said , "" although its name would not be enron online . ""
baum added that sempra could be interested in acquiring several enron assets , in the u . s . and abroad .
energy markets were calm wednesday . kevin fox , manager of commodities and trading for aquila energy , a kansas city , mo . - based energy trader , described markets as "" surprisingly orderly . ""
enron ' s troubles have been building for well over a month , fox explained , and so the halt of enron online came as no surprise . fox saw no difficulty in his firm and other trading companies fulfilling enron ' s contracts should the energy company cease to operate .
still , others saw disrupted markets and price volatility . fears about the aftermath of enron ' s collapse centered on long - term commitments the firm has made in recent years to handle all the energy needs of giant entities such as the university of california system or to supply 10 years of natural gas at a fixed price range to an electricity generating station .
problems could arise because long - term contracts typically become encrusted with related transactions that hedge against price movements over time or the interest cost of financing . such complexity could make it difficult for other firms to pick up enron ' s long - term contracts .
if enron in bankruptcy "" can ' t cover its obligations , maybe other wholesalers can ' t either , "" said gordon allott , vice president at kw international , a trading and risk management firm in san francisco .
"" and then you have customers going out into the spot market , which could drive prices higher . that ' s the big bogey monster out there , "" allott said .
however , any effect on consumers from such disruptions could be slight . gerald keenan , head of the energy practice at , noted that enron ' s collapse would not "" affect the basic supply and demand for electricity and natural gas , "" the true determinant of prices .
one major factor reducing the effect of an enron collapse on markets and energy supplies is the growth in recent years of energy trading into a broad industry , with more than $ 300 billion in annual activity in contracts for electricity and the natural gas and oil fuels that produce it .
the intercontinental exchange , a consortium of six trading firms , handles more energy trades today than did enron .
if sempra and other companies acquire and operate enrononline , the industry will have two major groups to rely on . the need for energy trading has been growing out of deregulation and change in the electric utility industry .
"" trading absorbs risks of fuel - price movements and the like that used to be passed on to retail customers in the form of adjustments to monthly bills , "" fox explained .
the breadth and expertise of this new industry , as well as the months of enron ' s decline that gave competitors and markets time to adjust , could promise a relatively stable aftermath of enron ' s downfall .
however , the post - enron future is likely to see closer regulation of energy contract trading to increase disclosure of terms and risks .
but enron and its top executives , along with the arthur andersen accounting firm , face months and possibly years of lawsuits from shareholders who suffered losses as enron ' s stock lost more than $ 60 billion of market value in a single year .
and lawsuits by enron employees , challenging the firm ' s treatment of 401 ( k ) accounts , will go forward even if enron is in bankruptcy , said attorney lynn sarko of keller rohrback , a seattle law firm that is bringing one of the suits on behalf of employees .
"" there is still liability faced by fiduciaries , officials who were administrators of the savings plan and by the companies that insured it , "" sarko said .

stocks tumbled wednesday amid investors ' nagging uncertainty about the economy and as energy giant enron headed toward financial collapse . meanwhile , treasury bond yields were little changed . after sliding early in the session , they rebounded after the government got a tepid reception for a record sale of two - year notes .
on wall street , the dow industrials slid 160 . 74 points , or 1 . 6 % , to 9 , 711 . 86 . the market was in a steady decline most of the session .
the tech - dominated nasdaq composite suffered a 2 . 5 % decline , off 48 points to 1 , 887 . 97 .
losers topped winners by about 2 to 1 on the new york stock exchange and on nasdaq .
early in the week the market seemed poised to retake the 10 , 000 level on the dow and the 2 , 000 level on the nasdaq index . instead , sellers have gained the upper hand .
analysts noted that many investors aren ' t convinced the economy will improve in the first half of 2002 . for weeks , hopes that business will improve early next year have been boosting the market .
"" we ' re not out of the woods yet "" with the economy , said richard jandrainof banc one investment advisors corp .
the federal reserve ' s latest report on conditions by region , released wednesday , painted a generally somber picture of the economy .
still , many analysts said stocks ' sell - off this week doesn ' t appear to be anything special .
"" the reality is , we were due for some pullback , "" said barry hyman , chief investment strategist at ehrenkrantz king nussbaum .
hyman and other analysts were actually pleased to see investors take a cautious step back after fearing that the market was rising too much and too quickly .
the market ' s softness was spread across most sectors , but one of the weakest spots was utilities , which dropped after dynegy backed out of its planned merger with enron .
nyse - listed enron broke the record for heaviest trading in a single day with more than 339 million shares changing hands , as it fell $ 3 . 50 to 61 cents . the previous volume record was the 304 million shares of intel traded on nasdaq on sept . 22 , 2000 .
investors were selling most utility stocks wednesday . the dow utilities average fell 2 . 9 % to a 52 - week low of 279 . 95 .
financial stocks were slammed on worries about spillover from an enron collapse . j . p . morgan chase sank $ 2 . 30 to $ 37 . 50 , and citigroup dropped $ 2 . 75 to $ 47 . 80 . both are in the dow .
retailing issues remained vulnerable to concerns that this holiday shopping season will be the worst in a decade . gap stumbled 79 cents to $ 13 . 61 after prudential securities reduced its rating on the clothier to "" sell "" from "" hold "" and called its holiday merchandise poor . electronics retailer best buy fell $ 1 . 18 to $ 69 . 90 , and bed , bath & beyond declined 74 cents to $ 32 . 34 .
technology also was weaker as investors fear there is still too much inventory and not enough demand . chip equipment maker altera fell $ 1 . 83 to $ 21 . 83 ahead of its update on business in the fourth quarter . after the market closed , altera reaffirmed its revenue projections for the year ' s final three months .
ibm , another dow stock , dropped $ 2 . 05 to $ 112 . 15 after announcing it will cut 1 , 000 jobs from its seven u . s . chip plants because of a slowdown in the microprocessor industry .
what was bad for stocks normally would be good for bonds , but that wasn ' t the case by the close of trading wednesday .
yields fell early in the day , then reversed after the government ' s biggest sale ever of two - year notes flooded the market with debt .
the treasury sold $ 21 billion of the two - year notes at a yield of 3 % , up from $ 19 billion sold in october , part of an effort by the government to finance a spending increase using short - dated debt .
the five - year t - note yield ended unchanged at 4 . 29 % . the 10 - year t - note ended at 4 . 93 % , up from 4 . 92 % .

after dynegy pulled out of its deal to buy enron corp . wednesday morning , it appeared the most likely option for enron was bankruptcy protection .
from wall street to houston , it was widely expected enron would file for bankruptcy , perhaps as soon as today .
"" it ' s probably imminent , "" said andre meade , a stock analyst with commerzbank securities in new york .
jeff mcmahon , enron ' s chief financial officer , said wednesday night that enron was evaluating all its options for restructuring its balance sheet and debt , and ways to return its business to health .
mcmahon said enron wasn ' t considering a chapter 7 bankruptcy filing , which would involve a liquidation or selling of all assets .
he didn ' t rule out a chapter 11 filing , which lets a company protect assets while it works out a reorganization plan , but he stressed that enron was also reviewing other options .
he declined to describe what the options are , but said he prefers to fix enron without a bankruptcy .
earlier wednesday , enron said it had suspended making payments other than those needed to maintain core business operations and it was working to retain employees needed for its trading and other core energy businesses . no layoffs were announced .
wall street doesn ' t believe enron has real choices other than bankruptcy . shares in enron lost much of their value wednesday , closing at 61 cents . the company , which was dropped from the standard & poor ' s 500 index , also broke the record for most shares traded in a day .
before oct . 16 , a buyout by dynegy , let alone a bankruptcy , were unthinkable for houston ' s largest company and the world ' s largest energy trader . but that day , enron disclosed millions in financial losses related to investment partnerships it did business with and were run by enron ' s since - ousted chief financial officer .
in the days and weeks that followed , the securities and exchange commission started investigating enron , a stack of shareholder and employee lawsuits were filed , enron restated earnings and made disclosures about its balance sheet that wall street found troubling .
dynegy swooped in to rescue enron when the two companies agreed to a merger deal nov . 9 . but continuing bad news surrounding enron put pressure on that deal .
until wednesday morning , it appeared enron and dynegy would find a way to rescue the merger by revamping its terms .
after several days of talks among the companies , bankers and others , chuck watson , dynegy ' s chairman and chief executive , said in an interview he concluded a solution wasn ' t reachable .
the final confirmation for watson was when standard & poor ' s wednesday morning cut enron ' s credit rating to so - called junk status , effectively halting enron ' s ability to run its core business of energy trading and marketing , which is dependent on access to cash and credit . that trading franchise was a key reason for dynegy ' s interest in enron .
s & p said in its rating report that it cut enron ' s credit rating because it didn ' t believe the merger , which wasn ' t expected to close for six to nine months , would go through .
when the companies inked the deal on nov . 9 , watson said he expected no more surprises about enron ' s financial state . but the deal included escape clauses just in case .
among reasons dynegy cited for ending the merger were "" breaches of representations "" by enron . it also invoked an escape provision that let dynegy to walk away if enron had a "" material adverse change "" in its business .
"" we have never been willing to risk our franchise , our credit or our credibility , "" watson said . "" we knew when to say no and this morning we said no . ""
since nov . 9 , enron made new financial disclosures and saw significant drops in its stock price and trading business . all of that caused dynegy to seek new terms for the merger agreement , including a lower price , cash infusions to stabilize enron and a restructuring of enron ' s debt repayment schedule .
watson traced the beginning of the end to nov . 19 , the day enron filed its 10 q with securities regulators . companies must file their 10 q every quarter with details of their earnings and balance sheet with the sec .
dynegy was hit by surprise when enron disclosed it would have to pay off a specific debt obligation worth $ 690 million almost immediately and when it saw that enron ' s cash situation wasn ' t what it expected , watson said .
those disclosures , he said , caused enron ' s trading business , which had somewhat of an uptick after the merger announcement , to go "" down again and down again . ""
"" that was sort of a blow that we never really recovered from , "" watson said .
watson said he worked hard to rescue the deal , but would only go for a "" global solution "" that would take care of all the problems . for one , he said , enron needed another $ 1 billion - $ 3 billion infusion to keep going .

another jolt

shortly after enron corp . ' s bond ratings were cut to junk status wednesday , energy trader charlie sanchez watched the company ' s trading business simply vanish from his computer screen .
"" i watched their different markets just peel off my screen , one by one , "" said sanchez , energy markets manager at gelber & associates in houston .
although enron ' s troubles were well - known , the collapse of enron ' s trading business wednesday still jolted traders . sanchez just said , "" i ' m in shock . ""
the downgrade of enron ' s debt was the first domino to fall wednesday , followed by the shutdown of enron ' s online trading business and then the announcement that dynegy had called off its deal to buy enron .
enrononline , the company ' s internet commodity trading platform , went down early wednesday , signaling that the company had temporarily halted trading altogether . enrononline handles about 60 percent of the company ' s trading business , or about $ 2 . 8 billion a day in deals .
enron ' s chief financial officer jeff mcmahon said he didn ' t know when enrononline would be up for trading again . however , the company continues to do telephone transactions , he said .
the commodities markets appeared to weather the event . but the shutdown of the company that was by far the biggest player in the market led other companies that regularly dealt with enron to hastily issue statements assuring investors they were not going to be dragged down as well .
with enrononline down , many traders had to revert to calling around to numerous sources to find out what the market was doing rather than simply logging onto enrononline and clicking on a single tab to size up the market where they wanted to trade .
but as far as the overall impact on commodities markets and the new york mercantile exchange , the loss of enron ' s trading business for whatever period likely will not be that big , said kyle cooper , oil analyst with salomon smith barney in houston .
"" it could widen the bid - ask spreads in a few places , but in terms of liquidity on the nymex , you ' re talking about a few thousand contracts out of 60 , 000 to 70 , 000 contracts in all , "" cooper said .
one trader described enron as "" a needle in a haystack in terms of the total long - term capital markets . ""
nonetheless , the shutdown prompted a call for closer monitoring during a briefing at the white house .
u . s . treasury department officials kept a close eye on the credit and energy markets wednesday but discerned no upheavals from the troubles at enron .
"" we are monitoring credit markets as we do every day "" treasury spokeswoman michele davis said . "" we haven ' t seen anything extraordinary . ""
the exit of enron will lead to a change in the balance of power in the trading business . traders said companies that likely will benefit from the loss of enron ' s trading activities include el paso corp . , mirant corp . , reliant energy and duke energy .
the market appeared more worried about possible losses connected with enron .
el paso corp . ' s stock took a beating wednesday - - down $ 3 . 59 to close at $ 44 . 91 - - over concerns that it had too much exposure to enron through its trading business . the company issued a statement saying it had "" systematically reduced its trading with enron "" over the past few weeks .
"" due to enron ' s loss of investment grade status , any new business will have to be supported by cash collateral . el paso foresees no material disruptions in the energy trading markets resulting from today ' s downgrades or the potential of an enron bankruptcy filing , "" according to the company ' s statement .
el paso ' s natural gas and power trading exposure to enron is about $ 50 million , the company said , adding that it does not expect any adverse earnings impact from enron ' s difficulties .
atlanta - based mirant said its exposure to enron is $ 50 million to $ 60 million , noting that it too had begun limiting its exposure risk early in what it described as "" the enron crisis . ""
calpine corp . said it had no "" net exposure "" to enron , which means that what enron owes calpine for gas and electric trading is offset by calpine ' s liabilities to enron .
enron faced a cash crunch in part because some trading partners lost confidence the company would have the cash to pay bills . as a result , they were either demanding more collateral to ensure it delivered on trades or restricting dealings with the houston - based company .
"" each company is going to have to evaluate what their situation is from producers to utilities , it ' s going to be a case - by - case situation . it ' s going to take a long time to figure it all out , "" said one trader who asked not to be quoted by name .
shortly after the news of the company ' s latest problems broke , a flood of huge trading orders came out of enron , leading traders to speculate that the company was scrambling to clear its accounts before filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection .
a typical order from the company would be for 100 contracts in a single lot to buy or sell commodities such as natural gas . after the debt downgrade was announced , single orders for 1 , 000 to 2 , 000 contracts began coming from the company .
the flood of large orders out of enron caused the near - month futures contract on the new york mercantile exchange to spike up and then fall off just as quickly in late morning trading .
"" they could not leave this exposure to the whims of the market , "" one trader said . "" they needed to get out . ""
enron reportedly has been working over the past few weeks to line up alternate parties to hand off their thousands of contracts the company handles daily , many of which are for long term periods such as 10 to 15 years .
but some of the more obscure contracts on items such as emissions credits and weather derivatives may be more difficult to unload . in addition to natural gas , power and oil , enron trades such items as broadband , paper , metals and water .
"" i really think that a lot of the kinds of stuff that is foreign and esoteric that enron has been making a market in will take a while for others to pick up , "" sanchez said .

bankruptcy filing by enron could be largest ever
by tom fowler
copyright 2001 houston chronicle
if enron files for chapter 11 bankruptcy this week , as many observers expect it will , it may be the largest such event to date .
with $ 61 . 7 billion in assets on its books as of sept . 30 , the deal would top texaco ' s 1987 bankruptcy , which sought protection for a company with $ 35 . 9 billion in assets . it would also beat the 1988 bankruptcy of financial corporation of america , which had $ 33 . 9 billion in assets .
the value of the assets and liabilities on enron ' s books continues to be a moving target , however . while enron ' s unaudited quarterly financial report indicates $ 61 . 7 billion in assets , $ 27 billion in liabilities , $ 6 . 5 billion in long - term debt and $ 15 . 3 billion in deferred credits , the turmoil of the past month has changed much of that .
on the asset side , for example , the company says properties like its natural gas transmission lines , fiber optic network and electric generation facilities are worth close to $ 14 . 6 billion . much of the gas pipeline properties have been encumbered in recent weeks , however , by the company ' s efforts to raise additional cash and credit from banks .
and the likelihood the company could find buyers to pay its asking price for assets like the fiber optic network or overseas power plants is highly unlikely , said ralph pellechia , a credit analyst with rating agency fitch .
"" it ' s really a buyer ' s market , not a seller ' s market , "" pellechia said . "" it ' s anticipated a lot of their assets , particularly their international assets , would go for a lot less than the initial investment in them . ""
the company also counts $ 7 . 1 billion in investments and advances to "" unconsolidated affiliates "" as assets , which could include enron equity that was used to back some of the complicated off - balance - sheet financing partnerships that led to the company ' s current woes . given the constant surprises surrounding those partnerships and the company ' s steeply dropping stock price - - now worth less than a cup of coffee - - that $ 7 . 1 billion figure is also suspect .
several unexpected debt obligations related to the partnerships enron operated have also changed the tally since sept . 30 . analysts say debts for the company range between $ 13 billion and $ 17 billion , including another $ 3 . 9 billion in debt repayments related to two special partnerships , osprey trust and marlin water trust , that will come due more quickly than expected following the credit rating agency downgrades on wednesday .
"" all these changes are making the situation like sand falling between their fingers , "" said bill porter , chairman of houston law firm porter & hedges . "" the only alternative left to them to stabilize their situation is bankruptcy protection . ""
company officials say they ' re still reviewing options , but on wednesday said they are temporarily suspending all payments to creditors other than those needed to maintain core energy trading operations .
"" with dynegy ' s termination of the merger and the ratings agency downgrades , we are evaluating and exploring other options to protect our core energy businesses , "" enron chairman and ceo ken lay said in a statement .
sources familiar with the broken enron - dynegy deal said the paperwork for a bankruptcy filing has been in the works for weeks , and even preceded the nov . 9 merger announcement . they say if the preliminary deal had not been secured that day , enron would have had to file for bankruptcy the following monday .
recent efforts by enron ' s bankers , including j . p . morgan chase and citigroup , to get creditors to hold off on demanding payments may mean the pending bankruptcy filing will be what is known as a prepackaged deal .
in a prepackaged bankruptcy , creditors agree beforehand how the sale of the company ' s assets would be divided among them . it would save all parties untold millions in legal fees that would be spent fighting over the company while assuring at least some recovery of their investments .
prepackaged bankruptcies are common , said jay westbrook , a professor at the university of texas school of law , because they allow companies to buy parts of the faltering business they want without the hassles of long , drawn - out legal battles .
"" the purchasers will essentially just pay their money and walk away , with the proceeds getting divided up among those holding claims , "" westbrook said .
chapter 11 bankruptcy has the added benefit of freezing the many lawsuits that have been filed by angry shareholders . those lawsuits would eventually be handled by the bankruptcy court , including determination of the validity of the claims in the suits .
if enron ' s bankruptcy is not prepackaged , it ' s almost assured that the value of enron ' s remaining businesses , such as its energy trading , will disappear , said bob chapman , a principle with houston management consulting firm king , chapman & broussard .
"" the only guys that do well in bankruptcies are the lawyers , "" chapman said . "" what you usually see is a long period of people trying to carve up the beast where what remains of the business will continue to atrophy . ""
because the company will most likely look to simply liquidate its assets , what would at first be a chapter 11 bankruptcy filing could later be converted to a chapter 7 filing , where a court - appointed trustee overseas liquidation of the remaining assets .
"" from our perspective , a lot of the future rests in the hands of the banks , "" said fitch analyst glen grabelsky . "" what their intentions are in granting forbearance , what kind of liquidity they ' re willing to extend to enron , only they can answer . ""

ballpark place project stopped dead in tracks
by ralph bivins
copyright 2001 houston chronicle
construction of the ballpark place tower has been postponed , partly because of the uncertainty surrounding enron corp . , the project ' s developer announced wednesday .
trammell crow co . had anticipated breaking ground this week on the 34 - story tower across from enron field , said matt khourie , who heads trammell crow operations in houston .
ballpark place was planned for a parcel of land owned by the developer , bounded by preston , prairie , crawford and la branch streets .
the $ 108 million ballpark place was expected to be a dominant skyline feature , rising over left field at enron ' s namesake stadium .
ballpark place would have included 253 , 000 square feet of office space , 216 apartment units , ground - level retail space and several levels of covered parking .
questions surrounding the future of enron corp . , a major employer in downtown , was key in encouraging trammell crow to shelve its plans , khourie said .
enron has about 3 million square feet of downtown office space , including a 40 - story building under construction . as enron ' s need for space decreases , the downtown office market is sure to feel the aftershocks .
"" given the national economic uncertainty and the uncertainty associated with the future availability of class - a space springing from the recent events at enron , we have decided to delay our construction start until the future visibility improves , "" khourie said in a written statement .
it has been widely speculated that dynegy , another houston energy firm , would move into the new enron building .
but dynegy ' s plans to buy enron fell apart wednesday , leaving questions about the the new 1 . 2 million - square - foot tower .
trammell crow has not abandoned its plans for ballpark place .
khourie said the company intends to start construction , perhaps next year , after the economy improves .

446,446,Ham,hi professor ripley thanks for the response i apologize my examples were not too real though your solutions are indeed clever i was trying to ask more generally whether the element name or index of 'listobj' could be obtained by the user function 'myfunction' when used in lapply x listobj fun myfunction below i illustrate two cases in which i have come across this desire escapenumber in 'example escapenumber' i essentially take the list element and do some transformations optionally some number crunching and then plot it with the element name of the list for the title escapenumber in

aesthetics since i thought the spirit of lapply was to operate on the elements of a list and not its indices i thought perhaps there is a way to get the index number and element name from within the user function also i recall a lesson on 'loop avoidance' from an earlier version of mass this was in the days of s plus dominance and perhaps less applicable now to r as you mentioned but old habits die hard my amygdala still invokes a fear response at the thought of a loop and as of recently i have been infatuated with the notion of adhering albeit loosely to the 'functional programming' paradigm which makes me doubly fearful of loops thanks and best regards stephen prof brian ripley wrote on tue escapenumber jun escapenumber stephen tucker wrote hello everyone i wonder if there is a way to pass the index or name of a list to a user specified function in lapply for instance my desired effect is something like the output of l list jack escapenumber sape escapenumber lapply seq

is clarity of code i think we need a real life example to see what you are trying to do but by passing l as the first argument of lapply i thought there was a tangentially related post on this mailing list in the past but i don't recall that it was ever addressed directly and i can't seem to find it now the examples above are perfectly good alternatives especially if i wrap each of the lines in names to return lists with appropriate names assigned but try something like l lapply seq along l function i x if i escapenumber jack else sape x l it feels like i am essentially writing a for loop

480,480,Ham,posted in devel just want to make sure people see this list trouble this week now fixed apologies for dups hello all tamtam team has been on the sideline the last few weeks to let the academic year conclude we are warming up the engine at half crew until juneescapenumberth and full tilt after that we have proposals and many questions our task list until september october will be like this escapenumber solidify tamtam on the new bescapenumber bescapenumbers we have enough cpu ram and file space to do what we need to do chunking out the audio data seems reliable but we would like to have better keyboard response onkey presses feel laggy this is largely due to our buffering we currently use escapenumber blocks of buffering escapenumber is desired but it causes crackles due to cpu choking this may not be true on the new machines be that as it may i think it will always be difficult to run tamtam and another app at the same time is this really a big problem we are considering a move to a escapenumberk sampling rate this would improve audio quality famously specially where headphones pods and external speakers are used this will be done with the sound bank revision cpu performance allowing resinstating microphone recording in mini and edit and keyboard recording in edit we hope this will be straightforward solve all popup window issues yes some remain we can do almost everything on the machines we already have but a bescapenumber bescapenumber will be essential to test the hardware performance escapenumber tamtam jam and minitamtam it is still uncertain if tamtam jam will be a separate sub activity we are thinking of making it an integral part of minitamtam which would be renamed the suite would thus revert to a three prong affair play compose make sounds the minitamtam performance music loops we have been investigating are what motivated this rethinking see below performance scenarios with sync locked loops will be the essence of tamtam jam along with screen feedback acting as a tutor for composed music we think tamtam jam will be the most used tamtam app four of us put together a little performance at the elektra festival elektrafestival ca last week it turns out the little machine makes a terrific orchestra instrument we had beats going sequences on individual keyboard keys imported sounds from synthlab we played only in minitamtam the four machines were connected to a minimal pa something that can be found in the most unlikely places in the world we did a little improv and the concept of playing xos as a band became immediately clear people can make music together in groups for rehearsal purposes with four or five people sitting around a table the small speakers are fine we could use a little more volume of course but in a quiet environment they are quite usable a hardware idea someone should think of the following device a tiny line mixer with escapenumber inputs and escapenumber outputs power requirements to include a modest line amplifier are minimal this device could be used for group music making teleconferencing activities and whenever you need to connect a number of machine audio together small plastic box perhaps two or three per schools with a variety of adapters to connect to any loudsepaker i wouldn't be surprised if you could make these things for less than escapenumber cents one thing needs solving a clock pulse over the mesh so the beats stay tight as it is you can start any number of machines on the default tempo and the machines will stay in sync for as long as two or three minutes this is musically useful but re synching manually kills the élan so we need this clock we have figured out how to do it in our code and will in all likelyhood use the presence service right now however the mesh remains slightly mysterious as to its usability we can shortcut with a pipe to csound itself and let it handle sync broadcast and reception outside the sugar environment but that seems the wrong way to go a central question remains will a lightly loaded mesh say escapenumber escapenumber machines show enough latency to be musically objectionable in pratice sync packets have to reach clients within escapenumberms with a prefferred figure of less than escapenumberms by the time the signal makes it up and down the software chain it gives us something in the order of escapenumberms to make the graphics do what they need to do at that moment this is acceptable as a drop dead timeframe outside this window the music is just going to gradually loose the groove can the mesh support this rate continuously if so we have a mightily rich collaborative music setup for one flavour of tamtam jam google dance dance revolution escapenumber sugar conformity and integration we will need to travel to boston for that and hopefully enroll eben as a scream across the hall consultant as much time we spent on the look and feel of tamtam we understand accept and even look forward to making it fit into the sugar graphical idiom the sugar controler toolkit is almost complete enough for our purpose one thing we will miss is a bidirectional slider but this is fairly easy kids want to know do we get editorial control over the final integrated look escapenumber tamtam tunes outside tamtam we want to propose a simple embeddeable tamtam player so kids can put their compositions into documents the player itself is simple enough to make abiword would be the first target any comments by the abi people would be welcome this is perhaps a problem for oom csound needs to be loaded and csound pre loads sound tables into ram and the full library at escapenumberk will pop a good escapenumber mb is this realistic escapenumber tutorials and field trials tamtam edit and synthlab are complex applications for a escapenumber year old we look at those as something a kid can grow into and there is lots to learn there we will develop text free tutorials to show the kids how to use the apps to that end is there a flash player in the works that can be used at small overhead we are planning some with kids analysis sessions in late june to see what works and what does not we also need feedback from kids abroad and developers who may have something to say about it are we expecting detailed reports from the field trials in brasil and nigeria escapenumber sounds the sound bank will be fully overhauled hopefully at escapenumberk sr on the sounds themselves what shoudl be the policy for a standard sound bank and what will be the mechanism for exchange of sounds over the mesh straight audiofile transfers via the sugar shared spaces these are intial thoughts and questions comments jp ethrop sugar mailing list sugar laptop org http mailman laptop org

482,482,Ham,here is the other article how enron blew it less than a year ago the houston based energy behemoth had everything money power glitz smarts new ideas and a ceo who wanted to make it the most important company in the world now its stock is down wall street is bearish and the ceo is gone what went wrong by mimi swartz the enron skyscraper near the south end of houston's downtown feels like the international headquarters of the best and the brightest the lobby in no way resembles the hushed understated entryways of the old fashioned oil companies like shell and texaco nearby enron in contrast throbs with modernity the people hustling in and out of the elevators are black white brown asian middle eastern european african as well as american born they are young mostly under escapenumber and dressed in the aggressively casual uniform of the tech industry the guys wear khakis polo shirts and banana republic button downs almost preposterously fit they move through the building intently like winners enron is nothing if not energetic a big brother size tv screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of elevators while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets people entering from the garage a sculpture of the corporate symbol an e tipped at a jaunty angle radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axis a starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffeinated multicolored inspirational flags hang from the ceiling congratulating enron on its diversity and its values one more giant banner between elevator banks declares enron's simple if grandiose goal from the world's leading energy company to the world's leading company for a while that future seemed guaranteed as enron transformed itself from a stodgy troubled pipeline company in escapenumber to a trading colossus in escapenumber it was a wall street darling with a stock price that increased escapenumber escapenumber percent in that sixteen year period with revenues that increased from escapenumber billion to escapenumber billion the very mention of the company in energy circles throughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy notes a escapenumber report from global change associates a firm that provides market intelligence to the energy business this enron was largely the creation of jeff skilling a visionary determined to transform american business hired sixteen years ago as a consultant by then ceo ken lay skilling helped build a company that disdained the old formula of finding energy in the ground hauling it in pipelines and then selling it to refineries and other customers instead it evolved into a company that could trade and market energy in all its forms from natural gas to electricity from wind to water if you had a risky drilling venture enron would fund it for a piece of the action if you wanted your megacorporation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined enron could do the job if you were a third world country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning power needs enron was there to build and build basically if an idea was new and potentially and fantastically lucrative enron wanted the first crack and with each success enron became ever more certain of its destiny the company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high tech world and in february of this year skilling reaped his reward when he succeeded lay as chief executive officer enron says skilling was a great marriage of the risk taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk taking mentality of the financial markets the enron story reflects the culture that drove american business at the end of the twentieth century like the high tech companies it emulated enron was going to reinvent the american business model and in turn the american economy maybe it was natural that this brave new world also produced a culture that was based on absolutes not just the old versus the new but the best versus the mediocre the risk takers versus the complacent those who could see the future versus those who could not the key was investing in the right kind of intellectual capital with the best and the brightest a company couldn't possibly go wrong or could it today enron's stock trades at around escapenumber down from a high of escapenumber in january the press cast enron as the archvillain of california's energy crisis last spring and skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for his relentless defense of the free market a long troubled power plant project in india threatened the company's global ambitions telecommunications in which enron was heavily invested imploded wall street analysts who once touted the company questioned its accounting practices some of the change in enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncertain times that has afflicted all of american business but the culture that the company created and lived by cannot escape blame enron jeff skilling says had a totally different way of thinking about business we got it at enron in fact you either got it or you were gone it was as simple as black and white it is not coincidental then that the color scheme of skilling's river oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he once headed here the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahogany floors black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets billowy sofas set off the jet black baby grand in the entry white orchids cascade from a black vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold white marble there is only one off color note after almost twenty years jeff skilling is no longer associated with enron having resigned abruptly after just six months as ceo once skilling was hailed as the next jack welch general electric's masterful ceo as one of worth magazine's best ceo's in america anointed in escapenumber and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unchained adventure junkets in which a friend told businessweek someone could actually get killed today he sounds more like ebenezer scrooge on christmas morning i had no idea what i'd let go of skilling says of all the personal sacrifices he made while retooling enron from a black chair in the white library across from a huge black and white photograph of his daughter and two sons skilling clarifies the demands of working escapenumber escapenumber for enron caused him to ignore his personal finances divorced he lived in a escapenumber escapenumber square foot house without a microwave or a dishwasher he almost missed his brother's wedding learning a foreign language i never learned a foreign language he exclaims he never once took his youngest son to school i'm interested in the kids you don't do kids in fifteen minute scheduling travel you can't go to africa for a week and get anything out of it skilling includes the study of architecture and design on his list of missed opportunities then he stops and sighs i'm not sure that fulfillment in life is compatible with a ceo's job he says finally then his eyes lock on mine and his voice which had softened regains its pragmatic edge it would have been easy to stay he says but that would not have been good for me he's a smallish ruddy faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight handsome in the way of corporate titans with piercing cheekbones and that assiduously stolid gaze but the impatience skilling once reserved for cautious underlings and dull witted utility company executives is now targeted at reporters who have labeled his resignation bizarre and associates who are bitterly skeptical of his need for family time his shrug stretches the limits of his shimmering blue button down and his matching blue eyes look put upon i'm surprised he says that people have so much trouble understanding this people who passed through downtown houston in the late eighties or early nineties couldn't help but notice a funny and for its time novel scene unfolding throughout the workday at the base of the enron building from nine to five and before and after you could see people slipping out of the pristine silver skyscraper to smoke they perched on the chrome banisters or lurked near the glass doors at the entry puffing like mad they always looked hurried and furtive even ashamed whatever people knew about enron in those days and most people didn't know much it was often associated with that scene enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters in houston and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with the energy world of the past what macho engineer would have put up with such humiliation but this company was a child of another time that period in the mid eighties when chaos enveloped the gas business federal deregulation of natural gas turned a steady secure industry in which gas pipeline companies frequently enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served into a volatile free for all the situation was compounded five years later by federal deregulation of the pipeline business so it happened that a gentlemanly gas pipeline company houston natural gas hng found itself under attack from coastal corporation oscar wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm hng was then run by lay a sturdy taciturn former economics professor and transco chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy his doctoral thesis at the university of houston was on supply and demand in the vietnam war lay who was from missouri and never succumbed at least outwardly to texas brashness had done well enough thanks to canny expansions hng's pipelines stretched from florida to california and throughout the state of texas hng fended off coastal but to protect the company from other takeover attempts lay nimbly engineered the sale of hng in escapenumber to a friendly nebraska pipeline concern called internorth one of the largest pipeline companies in the country at the time then a funny thing happened hng started acting in a way that would characterize the company for years to come a lot like coastal what the nebraskans blithely labeled the purchase was being called the merger back in houston and before long following some particularly brutal politicking between omaha and houston the company's center of gravity started shifting toward texas and shortly after that ken lay was running a new company called enron over time it became clear that lay had a better vision of the future says one person associated with enron at that time he never fought change he embraced change lay had won but what exactly did that mean enron was saddled with massive debt from the takeover attempt and thanks to deregulation no longer had exclusive use of its pipelines without new ideas for that matter a whole new business plan the company could be finished before it really even got started like many people who teamed up with enron in the eighties jeff skilling had spent a lot of time in the midwest and he was self made at fourteen he had been the chief production director at a start up tv station in aurora illinois his mother would drop him off there every day after school i liked being successful when i was working and i was smart he told businessweek earlier this year but unlike many of his enron colleagues skilling wasn't deliberate and soft spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock he was anxious and excitable and nothing but nothing excited him more than what he would come to call intellectual capital he loved being smart and he loved being surrounded by smart people he graduated from southern methodist university went into banking assets and liability management and took on harvard business school where he graduated in the top escapenumber percent of his class then skilling took the next step on what was then the new souped up path to american success he joined manhattan's mckinsey and company as a business consultant and that is where ken lay found him in escapenumber it is often said of lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless and his choice of skilling probably saved the company skilling was above all an expert at markets and how they worked while everyone else was worrying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry he alone saw the parallels between gas and other businesses and so in a world where credit was nearly impossible to come by skilling came up with what he called the gas bank which contractually guaranteed both the supply and the price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers enron would not be a broker but a banker it would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the risk involved and enron would make money on transactions much like an investment bank would skilling worked up some numbers and found them absolutely compelling then the mckinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about escapenumber enron executives he had a one page presentation almost to a person skilling says they thought it was stupid almost after skilling left the meeting dejected he walked ken lay to an elevator and apologized lay listened and then said let's go the gas bank was not an overnight success for months skilling woke up in a cold sweat sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of dozens of colleagues who had assisted him in fact he had come upon one of those divides that seem to define his life i believed this whole world would be different a huge breakthrough is the way skilling puts it today and even if he is typically immodest he was right fairly soon after launching the company sold escapenumber million worth of gas in a week true to skilling's character success turned out to be a matter of old versus new he says the joke around enron was that if a company's ceo was under fifty we were in and he was in too in escapenumber skilling finally left mckinsey and joined enron as the head of enron finance corporation a new division created just for him in escapenumber that company closed a deal that earned escapenumber million in profit after that says skilling we never looked back skilling and lay also realized that the gas bank couldn't work unless it had a trading component myriad trades were needed to build the market that would make the project go but by buying and selling enormous quantities of gas enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to dominate it the company had the best contacts the best intelligence and the best access to supplies that in turn attracted more customers who wanted to be part of the play with so many customers in its pocket enron could better predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to make trades for its own benefit enron could in effect bet on which way the price of gas would go as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans but with startling accuracy thereby generating profits higher than anyone could have ever imagined this change could never have occurred without another change skilling had made he created within enron a new culture to match its new trading business the idea was to build a knowledge based business which demanded a skill set not exactly prized by enron's employees from the old hng days most were deliberate cautious responsible somewhat defensive people most of them men of course the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an industry regulated by the federal government but now the company needed bolder people for its bold new era that included anyone who wanted to make money lots of money for themselves and for the company enron was going to create a niche for itself or die one former executive explains the people who had narrow views eventually were forced out because if they had narrow views about other things they had narrow views about the market skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people he wanted the smartest people from schools like harvard stanford and maybe rice and because his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company he wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the biggest and best investment banks like merrill lynch or credit suisse first boston in addition to being smart enron people were also supposed to be aggressive you were right for enron if you didn't want to wait until you were thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization you could see what he was looking for on super saturdays at the houston headquarters eight fifty minute interviews with ten minute breaks in between the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one day they were scored from escapenumber to escapenumber on their smarts their problem solving ability their passion for hard work and what at enron was called a sense of urgency people who scored less than escapenumber escapenumber were scratched the shrewdest candidates knew how to work enron before they were even hired these were the types that automatically turned down the company's first offer knowing enron would come back with more the starting salary was around escapenumber escapenumber maybe it wasn't a fortune yet but the signing bonus about escapenumber escapenumber was more than enough for a lease on the obligatory porsche boxster or one of the lofts being renovated close to downtown enron people didn't live in far flung suburbs suburbs were uncool and too far from the office for the lucky winners enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted and talented program new associates learned the latest techniques for structuring energy deals and there were rotations at enron offices around the globe the hours were long but every possible need was taken care of a company concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered with picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions shining shoes cleaning the house planning a vacation of course a lot of people who worked for enron never got to take vacations they were too busy making money but they could use the company gym and the company's personal trainers if they were overweight or wanted to quit smoking they could join enron's wellness program massages were offered six days a week from seven in the morning until ten at night they were so cutting edge rhapsodizes someone involved with the company health care program at the time they really thought about the psychology and what it took to keep these people going skilling handed out titles analogous to those at wall street firms analysts associates directors and managing directors but everyone knew that those titles didn't really matter money did instead of competitive salaries and decent bonuses enron offered competitive salaries and merit based bonuses with no cap if you really worked hard and delivered results you could make a lot of money says ken rice who stayed with enron for escapenumber years until resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband division or as the saying goes you got to eat what you killed gas traders with two or three years of experience could wind up with a escapenumber million bonus and the more you produced the closer you got to jeff real hot dogs joined him glacier hiking in patagonia land cruiser racing in australia or off road motorcycling in a re creation of the baja escapenumber escapenumber race ending at a spectacular mexican villa every time he'd speak i'd believe everything he'd say one loyalist says and why not by escapenumber enron had become north america's largest natural gas merchant controlling escapenumber percent of the market but at a company where the buzzword was aggressive that was no place to stop skilling and lay believed the gas bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better service at lower prices for consumers and untold profits for enron they began barnstorming the country pressing their case with entrenched power company presidents who with their multimillion dollar salaries and monopoly service areas had little incentive to change and energy regulators who were somewhat more receptive thanks in part to enron's generous lobbying efforts but the biggest winner of all was probably jeff skilling in escapenumber ken lay made him the president and chief operating officer of the company by then the division known as enron capital and trade resources was the nations largest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity the division had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees and revenues from escapenumber billion to escapenumber billion mr skilling's experience so far with the turmoil in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track the new york times noted everyone would certainly have thought so enron and skilling had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to transforming another firing up an idea machine enron is encouraging the entrepreneurs within sang the new york times in escapenumber in the staid world of regulated utilities and energy companies enron corp is that gate crashing elvis crowed fortune in escapenumber wall street was demanding tech size growth on a tech timetable and enron in escapenumber obliged with second quarter earnings of escapenumber million up escapenumber percent from the previous year that year the company seemed to discover a market a minute under skilling enron was trading coal paper steel and even weather no one blinked when a london wine bar became an enron client people drank more in warm weather than cold so why not buy a hedge against the usual winter downturn but most exciting to the financial world was enron's entry into high tech communications because of the company's marketing dominance enrononline became another overnight success handling escapenumber billion in commodity trades online in escapenumber enron as usual made its money on the spread between the bid price and the asking price then there was the broadband business to enron trading excess capacity in large high speed fiber optic networks empty lanes on the fabled information highway wasn't that different from trading the capacity of natural gas pipelines so enron created a market for what the industry calls bandwidth soon after it also announced a twenty year deal with blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people in their homes enron looked like a company that couldn't lose its strategy of building businesses shedding hard assets and trading various commodities can help it do well even in an uncertain market businessweek insisted there was however another reason enron did so well in such a short time the company's hard nosed approach toward its customers the old notion of customer service was based on the long haul you had to nurse and coddle customers to keep them but enron had new markets and new ideas customers had to come to it over time the company stopping referring to its business clients as customers and began calling them counterparties skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable gains were maximized by creating owning and then abandoning a market before it became overtaxed and overregulated so if you wanted to launch a high risk venture quickly such as zilkha energy's new high tech approach to drilling for oil you got your financing from enron because a bank would take forever to underwrite the project if it ever would but because enron invented its markets and subsequently dominated them enron could set the terms of its deals from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happened at all while many businesses used what was known in the industry as mark to market accounting for instance enron used it on an unprecedented scale the company priced their deals at current market value but it was always enron's idea of the market value companies that balked at their pricing didn't get deals and while old fashioned companies spread their profits out like annuities over a period of years enron took most of its profit up front however many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years they went on the books in the current year if a few analysts thought there might be something fishy about what they called subjective accounting investors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in as the market fluctuated and the landscape changed the company might abandon a project that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't going to be high enough enron is known for leaving people at the altar says one former employee winning the highest possible profits for the company could even extend to enron's attitude toward charity when a fundraiser for the houston read commission a literacy group called on enron for a contribution it was suggested that he start raising money for enron's competing literacy charity even the person who was supposed to give money away for enron was supposed to make money for enron he says as enron became more and more successful the culture skilling had created took on a dark side the competition turned inward as one member of the enron family put it it became a company full of mercenaries the change started at the bottom as enron's domination of the energy market grew most of the recruiting frills fell away new associates were treated much like the commodities the company traded global change's enron spies reported overhearing orders like i need a smart person go buy me one or buy me an intelligent slave quick enron had never been the kind of place where people sang to you on your birthday but now the workaholism bordered on self parody a random acts of kindness program lasted only a few months it was too disruptive people couldn't get their work done and of course enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension the performance review committee which had initially been installed by skilling in the capital group became known as the harshest forced ranking system in the country employees were rated on a scale of one to five and those with fives were usually gone within six months the prc's nickname quickly became rank and yank it was a point of pride that skilling's division replaced escapenumber percent of its workforce every year as one skilling associate put it jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery store skilling's approach to business get in and get out had become enron's attitude toward its workers in time it would become many workers' attitude toward the company teamwork never that valuable in a trading culture went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus if protocol required an enron higher up to come from europe to help with a project in the third world he might help or he might not depending on whether another potentially more lucrative project was pending elsewhere everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed they were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost sight of the future says one former employee anyone who couldn't close deals within a quarter was punished with bad prc scores as were the higher ups who had backed them past errors and old grudges were dredged up so often as new ammunition in prc meetings that the phrase no old tapes became an enron cliché people went from being geniuses to idiots overnight says one former enron executive in such a hothouse paranoia flowered new contracts contained highly restrictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company e mail was monitored a former executive routinely carried two laptops one for the company and one for himself people may have been rich at enron but they weren't necessarily happy one recruiter described the culture this way they roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while you bleed to death before jeff skilling could transform enron from the world's leading energy company into the world's leading company he had to make one more change just as he had done ten years before skilling had to purge the company of its remaining old order where enron once prized cautious executives who dealt with tangible assets like pipelines it now valued bold executives who dealt with intangible assets pipelines power plants they may have been enron's pride but skilling wanted them gone expensive long term building projects had no place when wall street was devoted to quick profits and enormous returns on investment capital and skilling knew it it wasn't the time for long term approaches an enron executive says of wall street's mood it was the technology era to rid enron of the last vestiges of its past skilling had to take on rebecca mark long considered his rival for the ceo's job mark was for many years the poster child for the enron way young attractive aggressive her nickname was mark the shark she came from sturdy midwestern stock but had the requisite harvard mba mark was largely responsible for the success of enron international the asset heavy side of the company where she developed escapenumber billion worth of gas and power plants which accounted for escapenumber percent of enron's profits in escapenumber for this she reaped breathtaking compensation one enron executive estimated escapenumber million and adoring press clips including two appearances on fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corporate america but then mark ran into trouble with a gas fired power plant in dabhol india one of the largest ever constructed she had played the game the enron way taking enron into a new market she had finagled low import taxes escapenumber percent instead of the usual escapenumber and hung in through escapenumber lawsuits and three changes in government but the time and expense needed to make india and other enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with enron's goals and skilling's impatience with mark grew forcing mark out however was no easy matter key executives left divisions were dismantled but she remained the truth was enron didn't mind firing lower level employees but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive relentless people it tended to promote the company preferred humiliation keeping a director in his cubicle say but failing to include him in the glamour deals or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title one particularly difficult executive won a few years at graduate school gratis a company as smart as enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public relations disaster so lay and skilling did something classically enronian they gave mark her own company despite skilling's contempt for asset heavy businesses enron spent more than escapenumber billion to buy a run of the mill british water utility that could serve as enron's entry into the emerging world of water privatization mark was put in charge of making enron yes the world's greatest water company azurix as the new business was called looked like another sure thing its ipo in escapenumber raised escapenumber million but mark had to succeed on enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a business fraught with political and emotional complexities water is not like gas or electricity owners and governments are a lot less willing to give it up even for lots of money the company stumbled layoffs commenced and confidence evaporated by august escapenumber the stock price which had started out at escapenumber had fallen to escapenumber mark's resignation followed and azurix much diminished was folded into enron i think it's best for rebecca to start afresh lay who had been a mentor to mark told the wall street journal or as one critic put it they were more interested in destroying the old culture than running a business as escapenumber drew to a close skilling was in total command in december ken lay announced the inevitable the best time for the succession to occur is when the company is doing well he told the press enron is doing extremely well now in february escapenumber jeff skilling took over the ceo's job almost immediately the trouble started enron's domination of the electric power market made it an instant target in the california deregulation debacle both pbs's frontline and the new york times took on enron portraying the company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in washington lay and enron's political action committee are the top contributors to george w bush to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying food or electricity skilling and lay appeared on camera singing belligerent anthems to the free market while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in california as both tried to buy power online the times reported that lay had tried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy deregulation the bad press was to say the least ironic just as the media was pounding enron for its omnipotence wall street was discovering its weaknesses by late march the stock price had slid to escapenumber a share from escapenumber in january within enron the asset based divisions took the rap for the decline the india plant continued to be enormously costly at least in part because of constant turnover within enron's management team but the california situation was more visible and therefore more damaging despite enron's claim that the state had never built enough power plants to service its population and never properly managed those it had for three months gray davis did a very good job of blaming us says mark palmer a vice president for corporate communications we were a texas company there was a texan in the white house california was a state that didn't put him in office and his biggest contributor was a texas energy company performance is going to take care of our stock price the truth will take care of gray davis california utilities still owe enron escapenumber million another reason stockholders might be panicky but more problematic than the crisis itself was skilling's all too apparent lack of contrition facing down his critics he cracked a joke comparing california with the titanic at least the titanic went down with its lights on but the biggest problem was enron's telecommunications division which had been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price investors believed that enron could revolutionize high speed communications just as it had revolutionized gas and power enron estimated the global market for buying and selling space over fiber optic cable would grow from escapenumber billion in escapenumber to escapenumber billion by escapenumber but then the tech bubble burst so too did the much hyped movies on demand deal with blockbuster for the first time in its confoundingly successful life enron had nothing new to take to market like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds enron suddenly looked less alluring to wall street skilling launched a campaign to keep enron's most important cheerleaders the stock analysts in the tent but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant during the reporting of first quarter profits he called an analyst who challenged enron's financial reporting an asshole when the company reported hefty second quarter profits many analysts questioned whether those profits had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old assets ignoring the growing chorus critical of enron's accounting skilling promised as he always had that innovations were just around the corner there wasn't any positive news carol coale of prudential financial says now basically he talked me out of a downgrade the business press so generous in the past turned surly fortune had asked in march whether enron was overpriced start with a pretty straightforward question how exactly does enron make its money the routine cashing in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portrayed in the media as a fire sale skilling had sold escapenumber million worth ken lay and ken rice close to four times that amount then the wall street journal reported on a fund run by the cfo that had been a source of strife within the company it was essentially risk management against enron's possible failures every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in the stock price by late august it had fallen below escapenumber enron so institutionally unforgiving finally got a taste of its own medicine when wall street is in love with a stock they're forgiving of something like accounting says carol coale when a company falls out of favor all these issues carry more weight this fact was not lost on people inside the company who suddenly started experiencing an attack of conscience those who had looked the other way as the most powerful enron executives dumped their wives and married their secretaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of their ways it just created an attitude one executive still at enron says if senior people are doing that why are we held to a higher standard there was a real culture of 'we're above everyone else ' loyalty had never been prized at enron so there was no reason to expect it now an old fashioned slow moving company like exxon could demand hardship duty in baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road but as one houston oilman explains if you have to negotiate a hardship duty with someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money then you have a corporation that's better suited for good times than bad as it turned out that description applied to jeff skilling too as the stock price stubbornly refused to ascend he made no secret of his unhappiness and frustration then after a trip to visit the families of three employees killed at a plant in england he had an epiphany life was short for him enron was over ever stoic ken lay returned to the ceo's office named a new president arranged a trip to new york to calm analysts and investors and promised a kinder gentler enron in the future trading anything and everything was out the company lay says will still innovate but innovate much closer to our core as for the culture things like the performance review committee i think we could have applied better by trying to categorize people into so many different categories you ended up creating a morale problem that skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to their lack of emotional intelligence despite skilling's lengthy tenure with enron he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul he'd always believed in cutting losses and moving on but now that he was abandoning them when the company was in trouble it was different even jeff's biggest detractors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door one loyalist admits but on the day we meet skilling is looking forward not back look he says with finality ninety percent of my net worth is in enron were my interests aligned with the shareholders absolutely free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures he is nestling himself back into the world of ideas his eyes flash as he talks about new technologies the first wave never gets it right he says the stand alone dot coms didn't work but the technological applications will create a second wave that will change the world houston he promises will become the world's center of commodity trading and he intends to be a part of it in fact he is already shopping for office space this is the second wave and enron's got it he says almost breathless there are thousands of people running around the streets of houston that get it ,
